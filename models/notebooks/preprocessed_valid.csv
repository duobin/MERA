laid foundation punk glam rock even influenced electronic music movements velvet underground able demystify sexual freedom drug culture 1960s matter fact observations new york street life served antithesis west coast feel good vibe created one influential prophetic albums time expressed alienation represented popular culture velvet underground quintessentially new york band embodied streets knew every way wrote songs real things saw certainly saw interesting things time andy warhols eclectic gang outcasts peers consisted artists junkies homosexuals transvestites like andy warhols pop art music antiart made antiart elitists heylin xi one first rock roll bands chance reaching mass audience clashed deeply much societys foundations music intellectual werent intellectual elitists traditional sense word took inspiration trashy paperback novels rather widely regarded literary classics first track sunday morning delicate album last recorded really track aims beautiful sort precursory reminder audience cacophony noise come intentional stemming lack musical skill knowledge sort attitude whole punk movement based upon punks adapted attitude preexisting musical knowledge wasnt necessary attitude ideas behind song really matters velvet underground served debut album opening number softest track prove werent relying solely shock appeal confrontational attitude sunday morning represents calm storm unclear whether song first last chronological order album song contains commercial sound album also somber lyrics reads like peaceful sunday morning long hard week new york city though overt confrontational rest songs shows multiple personalities one relatively sober albeit coming sings sunday morning im falling album takes moral stance crazy things theyve seen streets part represent real things going dream world everything always fine things hard confront reed sings ive got feeling dont want know could happened whats happen throughout album recognizes although album consists series vignettes representative ny street culture stories arent completely contained within album doesnt manage tie everything neat way stories album parts narrative audience let velvet underground used deep alienation beyond normal level even within biggest countercultural movement american history going couldnt didnt want find place within larger crosssection american culture place seemed fit andy warhols factory crowd selfdescribed group misfits instead going along hippies rebelling postwar conformity conservatism 1950s pushed boundaries even hippies west intentionally made people feel uncomfortable hippie music became popular eventually coopted mainstream like every large cultural movement jazz blues punk hiphop etc velvets pushed boundaries far could pushed nothing limits subject matter real dark portraying seedier side new york america whole instead singing specifically equality race relations racial issues subtly brought within narrative songs feel deeply rooted new york reed living im waiting man sings hey white boy town rest lines around unclear narrator song actually uptown sparking much debate straight forward first appears narrator looking buy smack another popular interpretation man song actually homosexual lover narrator theory comes lines narrator asked hey white boy chasin women around responds oh pardon sir furthest thing mind im looking dear dear friend mine dear friend may someone sold narcotics reed wasnt writing songs peace activist even outwardly promoting equality like west coast fond provides succinct ultimately telling story race relations new york city nonchalant conversational tone song set harlem predominately africanamerican community tone narrator addressed suggests white man business thus good hes

joyful section song opens singular guitar calm riff hat slowly builds added instrumentation layered top drums follow heartbeat user starting steady heroin injected becomes much frantic erratic around five minute mark screeching viola reaches pinnacle heartbeat drums driving forward faster faster almost drowning reeds vocals perhaps signifying drug doesnt allow minds thoughts fully come distorted
