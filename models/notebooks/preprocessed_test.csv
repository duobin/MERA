groove drum beat really change percussion elements top like congas cowbells change drum break fundamentally every song load bands trouble funk one number amazing dc bands still going actually happened gogo could get regional scene really work record day lot gogo records deliver 1 see band play live communicate audience lot based audience participation well lauren martin found track limewire finding

new version something would work many years kind way collaborate people hands else collaborated various processes shape individually adam bainbridge new record kind collaboration record decided get system work everyone predominantly kelela dev robyn equally creative terms contribution great session people people met music community play top game think really soulful professional player something incredible may taboo around using people gigs motown phil spector chic studio musicians mean coming great record collaboration definitely become good way hopefully bring best guess think production side best people normally like songwriting incredible vocals good example hearing someones music first time saying work person lauren martin okay lets play bank head kelela gorgeous record yeah kelela somebody might unfamiliar heard voice woman behind voice adam bainbridge kelela probably favorite living vocalist black woman ethiopian heritage originally washington dc remember hearing track probably soundcloud thinking holy shit move heaven earth work voice guess nice either serendipity still took bit work collaborating first release lot night slugs fade mind guys time remember putting email someone saying working kelela right like yeah come meet la literally first day met cut vocals ended album normally like get know people first maybe hang get drunk drunk together hung together probably bond life lauren martin like level playing field adam bainbridge know seen best worst came studio played demos time otherness one long strip turned lights sat back room handheld mic like fancy vocal mic improvised twice said oh melodic ideas vocal parts adlibs geneva example sound hearing song first time second take edit purely melody came mouth track start finish voice kind melodic gift remember sitting going oh oh dear bit like ghostbusters cross streams universe going end lauren martin kelela kind obviously want collaborate best people possible people think talented could affinity rather something common say really awe voice really like feel singing music working singers must anxiety work adam bainbridge yeah know answer really choice thing music get uncomfortable every time go real talk lauren martin like real talk cool adam bainbridge part guess people want also partly personality want melody production songwriting cannot justify releasing music sing people might able hear little bit personality production song kind vocal range might well go knowing get support better vocalist layer things make sound good would dishonest try knowing even favorite thing world also part honest making music might well make vulnerable might well open things scare joubert singers talking night even great singers studio session interesting broke four alone room trying takes song know picked shy one point like want sing part make adlib starting hold back mic even best singer world probably hangups voice also part collaboration think really glad session together show people mainly producers issues come producing vocal emotional kind scary intense real kind person hope get together work incredible lauren martin work vocalists though work producers engineers live musicians anybody particular really stands know video would quite like play somebody work adam bainbridge special video dev finished last album cupid deluxe hanging london week looking pictures eddy grant georgetown guyana like damn would amazing went georgetown shot video new record like sounds crazy like know film directed video really like care come like serious leave go back airport way cab texting really serious going cost money cannot fly halfway across world make video know shoot film well idiot like want let us show video chamakay blood orange lauren martin worked track directed

come together like adam bainbridge working one gift really thought joking sudden plane intense lot work imagine going country friends mother friend meeting family first time whole thing start finish like trip cannot believe nice document well way think important going fact got video bonus think terms music video well self directing self directed new one came couple days ago amazing think thing maybe people room starting make music videos tracks maybe still making videos amazing think might necessarily better alternative really great directors frequently make incredible pieces work peoples tracks flip side make video know much spending get choose spend reason lot comes across mediums also financial thing video production company might ask 10 00020 000 honestly 1 000 cut middle men interest label tell think normal way works video paid half artist half label label puts money whatever costs debt half cost video fine manage keep budgets small adds little bump total amount recoup label going say label makes major label artists spend half million dollars video never gets released artist management like think good idea another quarter million dollars debt label might manage clear got careful video really expensive equally maybe appropriate thing track could shooting selfie cam iphone let anyone stop lauren martin speaking expensive live band go tour curious know sure lot people go working studio music transferring live show something lot people lot people gotten ambitious much bigger undertaking packing van put together band happy trials tribulations point happy adam bainbridge pandoras box let us honest actually easy reason many ambivalent stories things always smooth part guess expected either putting band together ways putting record stage especially heavily electronic simplest way probably vocalist backing tracks honestly point adding things might add keyboard player might add vocalists drummer things fundamentally live acts start original studio version track build well guy called blue may musical director first record one also ended mixing second record shout blue helped find musicians live band first time around ended working chris egan bryndon cook play solange knowles well chris egan also drums blood orange live band okay live band costs money lot people room solo artist starting producer band splitting proceeds gigs four ways musicians

gareth adam bainbridge hi gareth comes back said actually music masters licensing someone maybe even negotiated good deal label working possible signed label talk specifically streaming income ratios much royalty going pay could good place kind dumb royalty ratios streaming royalty ratio physical cd around 6 roughly every one sold traditional reason overheads producing marketing spent things around releasing record digital stream overhead uploaded server somewhere cost label anymore money paying 6 make sense progressive labels signed contract music might actually pay 50 royalty streaming alone pretty good better 6 going get played couple million times 2015 sometimes owned master maybe thousand pounds month make difference gareth feel like becoming common thing heard form musician particularly independent side things thom yorke really refreshing hear people saying works works adam bainbridge better alternative things bandcamp ways selling music directly people want hear point unless something completely unexpected comes along see everything going towards streaming model makes sense particularly like think devalues music overall way netflix become goto moving video tv streaming become thing music meet music fans people industry said great actually bought record itunes record bought year like well honored bought one record year yeah stream everything else adverts mean anyway gareth seems like people using discovery going buying records theory adam bainbridge potentially gareth side note vocals really attracted record imperfection cool adam bainbridge
