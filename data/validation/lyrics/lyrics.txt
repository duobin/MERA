His father died and left him a little farm in New England.All the long black funeral cars left the sceneAnd the boy was just standing there aloneLooking at the shiny red tractorHim and his daddy used to sit insideAnd circle the blue fields and grease the night.It was if someone had spread butter on all the fine points of the stars'Cause when he looked up they started to slip.Then he put his head in the crux of his armAnd he started to drift, drift to the belly of a ship,Let the ship slide open, and he went inside of itAnd saw his daddy 'hind the control board streamin' beads of light,He saw his daddy 'hind the control board,And he was very different tonight'Cause he was not human, he was not human.And then the little boy's face lit up with such naked joyThat the sun burned around his lids and his eyes were like two suns,White lids, white opals, seeing everything just a little bit too clearlyAnd he looked around and there was no black ship in sight,No black funeral cars, nothing except for him the ravenAnd fell on his knees and looked up and cried out,"No, daddy, don't leave me here alone,Take me up, daddy, to the belly of your ship,Let the ship slide open and I'll go inside of itWhere you're not human, you are not human."But nobody heard the boy's cry of alarm.Nobody there 'cept for the birds around the New England farmAnd they gathered in all directions, like roses they scattered

Watch me ride...Take my words and the bass,Taste, and then swallow me,I'm chasing the devilCos you're level if you follow meFor quality, and I make no apologyFor linking my thinking with computer technology.Cos this is like a modern day hymnFor the new church,I search for the truth,I've got a hole in my tooth,I'm Uncouth, yes sir,I'm from the street universityWhere we learn to earn even in times of adversity.And I will find the easy way out of a hard timePetty crime sometime,But now I'm inclined to findA fresh direction,Check out the funky section.Cos this is the part where I start to rip up words,A comfort coming straight from my heart,I'm not a mystic, my views are realistic, simplistic,One special brew I get pissed quick,And get sick so I don't do it no more,I won't find peace of mindRolling around on the floor.The point I want to make,Is you can never escape from your fate,The mistake is to take without givin',From within,You know how I'm living,
How can I change the worldIf I can't even change myself?How can I change the way I amI don't know, I don't know[Incomprehensible], tell me[Incomprehensible][Incomprehensible], tell me[Incomprehensible][Incomprehensible], tell me[Incomprehensible]I wanna take a look at the world behind these eyesEvery nook, every cranny reorganizeRealize my face don't fit the way I feelWhat's real?I need a mirror to check my face is in placeIn case of upheaval, fundamental movement belowWhat's really going on I wanna knowBut yo, it don't show on the outside, so slideJust below my skin I'm screaming
I'm on lonely street age nearly threeRecently Mama's crying all the timeIs it because of me or my younger sister,Even Dad was weeping when he kissed her.Face all puffy like a blister,Crying like he missed her.Since we moved away from the house,Where we used to play.They say I'll understand on day but I doubt it,Mama never say nothing about it.How'd it get to be so crowded.I found it a strain, everywhere I look I see pain.And I can't escape the feeling,Maybe I'm to blame. So I strain to listen,Praying for a decision, wishing they where kissing.This feels like extradition or exile,Mama finds it hard to smileSo I make pretend cups of coffee in her favorite style.She says child I'm working so there's nothing you lack.But she know I want my Dad I want my family back.I'm on Lonely Street, age forty three.Couldn't gauge when to quit so my wife quit me.Took offense, took the kids,
Blackbird singing in the dead of nightTake these broken wings and learn to flyAll your lifeYou were only waiting for this moment to ariseBlackbird singing in the dead of night
Dime, ¿porqué te me vas y nada puedo hacer?¿Que pecado cometí para marcharte así, de mí?Se que esta es la ultima vez que me verás y te veréYa no es fácil olvidar, perdí la oportunidadNo me puedo perdonar, sigo mi caminoY sigoSolaConmigo caminando a solasMi mundo se derrumba todoMe queda seguir, esperar y cambiar y llorar y dejarlo todoQuitarme el llanto de mis ojosAlimentando esta ilusión y soportando este dolorCaminar por las calles y verQue las cosas no pueden volverVer la gente a mi lado pasarSin que puedan y quieran pensar
If you believe in the power magic,I can change your mindAnd if you need to believe in someone,Turn and look behindWhen we were living in a dream world,Clouds got in the wayWe gave it up in a moment of madnessAnd threw it all awayDon't answer me, don't break the silenceDon't let me win
If I had a mind to,I wouldn't want to think like you.And if I had time toI wouldn't want to talk to you.I don't careWhat you do,I wouldn't want to be like you.I don't careWhat you do,I wouldn't want to be like you.
Time, flowing like a riverTime, beckoning meWho knows when we shall meet againIf everBut timeKeeps flowing like a riverTo the seaGoodbye my love, Maybe for foreverGoodbye my love, The tide waits for meWho knows when we shall meet again

Love, what have you done? Oh, wow.I was sure up to now that she was a friend.I stayed till the end. Don't be a fool again.I once believed that love was fair.But I don't anymore.

(Don't want to be a fool.)Said I don't want to be a fool ever again.

Here I go again, got a broken heartThis time I'll get strongerNo grieving 'til the break of dawnAin't falling easily no longerDreams I dream will at last come trueSkies will clear, leaving me bright and blueI will raise my glass to my heart and sayHere's to tomorrow, not yesterdayHere's not to dreams that dont come trueHere's not to what was me and youHere's not to all the days gone byAnd to the truth that lived a lieDreams I dream will at last come true
I went looking for someone I left behindYeah, but no one just a stranger I did findI never noticed, hadn't seen it as it grewThe void between us where the flame turns blueDifferent places, yeah, but they all look the sameDreams of faces in the streets devoured by namesI'm in collision with every stone I ever threwAnd blind ambition where the flame turns blueWords dismantled, hey, and all the books unbound
Thinking of tomorrowWith the sunset in your eyesI feel everything and sorrowSo I have to say goodbyeDidn't think that we would love like thisI never thought that I would careSlowly now I read the writingIt can free us if we dareIf there isNew loveNew ways
The look of loveIs in your eyesA look your smile can'tDisguiseThe look of loveIs saying so much more thanJust words could every sayAnd what my heart has heardWell it takes my breath away[Chorus:]I can hardly wait to hold youFeel my arms around you
I watch you waitAt the bus stop with one eyeOn your watchYou turn and sayTo strangers there's not enough timeFor one man in one lifeJust a flicker and then a breezeBreeze, breezeBut you sit there for hoursWatching programmes you don'tPlan to watch they just come on
City lights shine on the harborNight has fallen downThrough the darkness and the shadowI will still go onLong long journeyThrough the darknessLong long way to goBut what are miles across the oceanTo the heart that's coming home?Where the road runs through the valleyWhere the river flows
Somewhere when the day is overThere's a heart a little colderSomeone said goodbyeBut you don't know whySomewhere there is someone keepingAll the tears they have been weepingSomeone said goodbyeBut you don't know whyIs there a reasonWhy a broken heart begins to cry?Is there a reasonYou were lost although you don't know why?Give me a reasonWhy you never want to say goodbyeIf there's a reasonI don't know why
It's only now, when words are saidThat break my heart in twoI wonder how you can endureAll I've said, all I say to you.How strong, how brave, how true of youTo bear the hurt I gave.
How I remember sleepless nightsWhen we would read by candlelightAnd on the windowpane outsideA new world made of snowA million feathers falling downA million stars that touch the groundSo many secrets to be foundAmid the falling snowMaybe I am falling down

Something's gotta change againI'm losingMy inspiration's goneOh no, oh noSeeing through some different eyesI can't findMy medication failedAgain, againI can feel a change, I can feel, can you feel it?See it on the streetWatching heat from the pavementCause I'm hereReady to take it all hereEverything's feeling unclearI wish it was rainingCause I hate every beautiful day
I'm bouncing off the walls again, woah ohAnd I'm looking like a fool again, woah ohI threw away my reputationOne more song for the radio stationI'm bouncing off the walls again, woah ohAnd I'm looking like a fool again, woah ohWaking up on the bathroom floorPull myself back together just to fall once moreAnd my heart's beating out of my chest, woah ohAnd this town is still making me sick, woah ohAnd every penny from my last paycheckI've blown it on you

I couldn't sleep last nightMy ears were ringing in my headBest friends with the boogie manI may be better off here deadRunning on empty once againToo tired for tears I dreadSink deep into those magic dreamsWhile I blast off in my bedAnd you know I played it all in hereWhere everyone hides their darkest shades of fearsAnd I threw my whole night down the drainYou know cause everyone says that I'm not the same
Last night I just wanted to have funTo go out with my friends, I took my Dad's carI never thought he would find outBut I crashed in a wall man I'm deadI guess it's no useI'm screwing up every little thingI ever tried to do, I'm born to loseYeah, yeah, yeah, yeahGod must hate me he cursed me for eternityGod must hate me maybe you should pray for meI'm breaking down and you can't save meIt's fuckin' hell and I wanna go home, I wanna go homeLast night I had to study for this testI forgot man I'm dead
I open my eyesI try to see but I'm blindedBy the white lightI can't remember howI can't remember whyI'm lying here tonightAnd I can't stand the painAnd I can't make it go awayNo I can't stand the painHow could this happen to me?I've made my mistakesGot no where to runThe night goes onAs I'm fading awayI'm sick of this life
A few questions that I need to knowHow you could ever hurt me so?I need to know what I've done wrongAnd how long it's been going onWas it that I never paid enough attention?Or did I not give enough affection?Not only will your answers keep me saneBut I'll know never to make the same mistake againYou can tell me to my face or even on the phoneYou can write it in a letter, either way, I have to knowDid I never treat you right?Did I always start the fight?Either way, I'm going out of my mindAll the answers to my questionsI have to findMy head's spinningBoy, I'm in a dazeI feel isolatedDon't wanna communicateI'll take a shower, I will scourI will rubTo find peace of mindThe happy mind I once owned, yeahFlexing vocabulary runs right through meThe alphabet runs right from A to ZConversations, hesitations in my mindYou got my conscience asking questions that I can't findI'm not crazyI'm sure I ain't done nothing wrong, noI'm just waiting'Cause I heard that this feelingWon't last that longNever ever have I ever felt so lowWhen you gonna take me out of this black hole?
Sometimes I feel like I don't have a partnerSometimes I feel like my only friendIs the city I live inThe city of citiesLonely as I amTogether we cry we cry we cryI don't ever wanna feel(Like I did that day)Take me to the place I love(Take me all the way)I don't ever wanna feel(Like I did that day)Take me to the place I love(Take me all the way)I drive on his streetsCoz he's my companionI walk through his hillsCoz he knows who I amHe sees my good deedsAnd he kisses me windy

Back in my room againA smell of cheap perfumeTrapped in myself againPrepared to meet my doomPermanent reflectionA need for mental foodAfraid of my actionsHere in this solitudeSo predictableAnd conventional
I'm uncleanUndress meSo unrealThe frame I seeI stand stripped to the waistBefore myselfIs it really meOr what I'm trying to beI won't drownIn my tearsAnd go down
Coming from the starsInto that spaceNo healingWhen a lonely heart's displacedLeft behindIn a foreign landSo should he dareTo reach out his small hand
Once I had a dream before I woke upWhen I try to walk I fall asleepDon't know where I'm going to,I don't even know where I have beenBut still I try to realize the truthThat I have seenSo I prayPlease, help me, pleasePlease, help me, pleasePlease, help me, pleasePlease, help me, please
I took a taxiFrom LA to Venus in 1985I was electromagnetically sucked backInto the party going on that nightAnd it was the glory of the 80'sWith karma drawn up in linesAnd two bugle boy models saying"Baby, it's a freebie you sure look deprived'I had the Story of O in my bucket seatAnd my wanna be MustangAuditioning for reptileIn their Raquel Welsh campaignIn the glories of the 80'sYou said, "I'm not afraid to die"I said, "I don't find that remotely funnyEven on this space cake high"And then when it all seemed clearJust then you go and disappear, disappear
It's time to change, throw out the books and start againBreak all the rules, fall on your face, don't be ashamedYou can't waste more time, 'cause you've been gone for far too longTrapped in his arms, safe without harmFollow your heart, don't be afraidYou think that you're OKBut I don't believe in what you sayYou think that it's too lateBut it's not good, good enough for you
Do you ever feel like breaking down?Do you ever feel out of place?Like somehow you just don't belongAnd no one understands youDo you ever wanna run away?Do you lock yourself in your room?With the radio on turned up so loudThat no one hears you screamingNo you don't know what it's likeWhen nothing feels alrightYou don't know what it's like to be like meTo be hurtTo feel lostTo be left out in the darkTo be kickedWhen you're downTo feel like you've been pushed aroundTo be on the edge of breaking downAnd no one's there to save youNo, you don't know what it's likeWelcome to my lifeDo you wanna be somebody else?Are you sick of feeling so left out?
It's cold around me, the night is youngThe sun has fallenAnd I've become the lonely oneThe moon is dancing among the cloudsAnd my knees are shakingAnd my dreams are brakingBut I know I liveBut I know I live, todayI know we could Live Tomorrow(Live Tomorrow)But I know I live todayI know we could Live TomorrowBut I don't think we should wait, noI know we could Live TomorrowBut I know I live todayI know we could Live Tomorrow
Don't be a stranger(Don't be a stranger)Don't think that we are that different(We aren't as different)We aren't as different as we thinkWe're closer than we knowI see us running(See us running)I see us run the race of success(Only after success)I see us run for the diamondsRun for total control
Howling, how long?Sounding, so calmPounding, so strongFoundin', so wrongHowling(Howling)How long?(How long?)Strolling, so longLollin', some songFirin', a gunDarkness, has come
You feel frozenBut you've been chosenYou lay there drunkenYour dreams seem sunkenYour world's a small oneAnd you break the rulesYou're one big fishIn a bowl of foolsTired of serving up your townTired of wearing that crownTired of sliding up and downTired of being you
Things of change, this time around,I'm on rocks I'm looking down,And I can see the whole the darkness 'round here.You're in spain and you walking freeI'm inside without the key,Feeling sick and angry toward you.Locked away, I'm going mad,I'm a fool, I'm so sad,
It's taking time to come aroundTime to bring me downNow I'm moving.I always knew the truthThough it's nice to have some proofIt's so soothing.Tears run down my faceAs you spray me with your maceI thank youI'd love toCut your throatYou'll never sing a noteI thank youI'm almost doneThis ain't no fun(That is something)He's trying.(That is something)
(Alright)I am the newFor reasons I can never explainI speak the truthI put an end to all your painI want guilt, I want to drag you right through your pastI'm on a roleAnd I'm moving way to fast(Alright)Aren't we always looking over our shouldersAren't we always drawing guns from our holsters

Every time I think that I'm the only one who's lonelySomeone calls on meAnd every now and then I spend my time at rhyme and verseAnd curse those faults in meAnd then along comes MaryAnd does she want to give me kicks, and be my steady chickAnd give me pick of memoriesOr maybe rather gather tales from all the fails and tribulationsNo one ever seesWhen we met I was sure out to lunchNow, my empty cup tastes as sweet as the punch(...)

What's this? A little dust in my eyeWell I'm not the type to cryIt's four a.m. I'm standing by the bed where you lieSleeping the sleep of the newbornI put [my] finger to your lips. Warm air.Five a.m. You lift your hand and open it.Then you slipped away. You slipped away.Oh death, that creep, that crooked jerk...He comes, he comes walking. He comes sneakingDown that long irreversible hallwayGrabs you in your sleepI walk outside to the parking lot.Bright coins of water on the sidewalk.

One, two, three, four!Why should, you leave your home,Oh, when the TV's on,Oh, when I was half joking,But I know that you'll be fine,Who needs love when you got two eyes and you got the time?
I want you to come home.I'm tired of being alone.And it's making me sick not knowing if you're safe and alrightThe kids are growing up so fast.And knowing you're missing them.And they're missing you, has given me a pain so deep inside.Something from this world cant explore.Lately I feel like I've been becoming someone else.Someone I don't recognise, and someone I don't even like.I need you here to help me remember what it's like to truly be alive.Everyday I try my best to not get completely overwhelmed with you being gone.Please tell me how to be strong.Because everyday I am so worried I could lose you.There are so many things going on, so many things I want to share with you.I'm selfish for wanting you home, I know, but I really cant help it.

Okay, yeah, alrightI find it hard to say that everything is alrightDon't look at me that way, like everything is alright'Cause my own eyes can see through all your false pretensesBut what you fail to see is all the consequencesYou think our lives are cheap and easy to be wastedAs history repeats so foul you can taste itAnd while the people sleep too comfortable to face itHis life so incomplete and nothing can replace itAnd while the people sleep too comfortable to face itYour life's so incomplete and nothing can replace itFret not thyself I say against these laws of man'Cause like the Bible says, his blood is on their hands

I don't know what your looking forYou haven't found it baby, that's for sureYou rip me up and spread me all aroundIn the dust of the dead of timeAnd this is not a case of lust, you seeIt's not a matter of you versus meIt's fine the way you want me on your ownBut in the end it's always me aloneAnd I'm losing my favorite gameYou're losing your mind againI'm losing my babyLosing my favorite game
I'm glad you came around todayI sure need a good companionI'm losing it but you're the sameWithout you I move at randomAbusing you 'cause you're a friendAnd there's no Jesus here to explainAnd take me higherCome take me higherCome take me high above our time
One, two, three, fourHey baby come 'roundKeep holding me downAnd I'll be keeping you up tonightA four letter word got stuck in my headThe dirtiest word that I've ever saidIt's making me feel alrightFor what it's worth I love youAnd what is worse I really doFor what it's worth I'm gonna run, run, run
Arrange my books in orderMake up some nice stories to amuse youMake things look smart and easyShape up the placeHungry for the meetingThe dinner we'll be eatingWine that we'll be drinkingAnd kinky thoughts I'm thinking
Look down from a broken skyTraced out by the city lightsMy worlds a mile highBest seat in the house tonightGive me your eyes for just one secondGive me your eyes so I can seeEverything that I keep missingGive me your love for humanityGive me your arms fo r the broken heartedThe ones that are far beyond my reachGive me your heart for the ones forgottengive me your eyes so I can seeStep out on a busy streetSee a girl and our eyes meetDoes the best to smile at meTo hide whats underneathThere's a man just who arrivedBlack suit and a bright red tieTo ashamed to tell his wife
Slow, slow, slowThere is something you need to knowThere's a feeling I don't understandHere it comes againGlow, glow, glowThere was love ten seconds agoIn it's place, now a tiny painIt comes againThere'll be rain on our wedding dayAnd the chapel will be mud and clay
Close your eyesLook at all these losersYou find them everywhereThey're fucked up and annoyingBut somehow you seem to careIt's easier to laughBut something makes you stick aroundYou can't watch from aboveAnd keep your ten toes in the sandYou wish that you were specialI'm just like you
I wonder what it's likeSeeing through your eyesYou've offered me to have a tryBut I was always lateThe filters that I useGive me an excuseI take away what's realI feel it and it blows my fuseI hang aroundFor another roundI'm hanging around
Don't blame your daughter,That's just sentimentalAnd don't blame your momFor all that you've done wrongYour dad is not guilty,You came out a little faultyAnd the factory closed,So you can't hold them liableYou come from an island,You're cutting diamonds with a rubbery knifeYour autograph's worthless,So don't send me lettersAnd don't mail me cash
Love don't come so easilyThis doesn't have to end in tragedyI have you and you have meWe're one and a million, why can't you see?I'm waiting, waiting for nothingYou're leaving, leaving me hangingWhen did your heart go missing?When did your heart go missing?I treat you like a princessBut your life is just one big messWhen did your heart go missing?When did your heart go missing?YeahI meant every word I saidI never was lying when we talked in bedI'm retracing every step in my headWhat did I miss back then now we're so, so misled
Yeah, what you critics said would never happenWe dedicate this album to anybody people said couldn't make itTo the fans that held us down till everybody came aroundWelcomeIt's hereLast summer we took threes across the boardBut by fall we were a cover story "now in stores"Make us poster boys for your sceneBut we are not making an acceptance speechI found the safest place to keep all our old mistakesEvery dot com's refreshing for a journal updateSo long live the car crash hearts
It's all a game of this or that, now versus thenBetter off against worse for wearAnd you're someone who knows someoneWho knows someone I once knewI just want to be a part of thisThe road outside my houseIs paved with good intentionsHired a construction crew'Cause it's hell on the engineAnd you are the dreamer and we are the dreamI could write it better than you ever felt itSo hum hallelujahJust off the key of reasonI thought I loved you, it was just how you looked in the lightA teenage vow in a parking lot'Til tonight do us partI sing the blues and you swallow them too
How cruel is the golden rule?When the lives we lived are only golden-platedAnd I knew that the lights of the city were too heavy for meThough I carried karats for everyone to seeAnd I saw God cry in the reflection of my enemiesAnd all the lovers with no time for me
I'm gonna make you bend and break (it sent you to me without wings)Say a prayer, but let the good times rollIn case God doesn't show(Let the good times roll)(Let the good times roll)And I want these words to make things rightBut it's the wrongs that make the words come to life"Who does he think he is?"If that's the worst you've gotBetter put your fingers back to the keysOne night and one more timeThanks for the memoriesEven though they weren't so great"He tastes like you only sweeter"One night, yeah, and one more timeThanks for the memoriesThanks for the memories"See, he tastes like you only sweeter"
I'm a stitch away from making itAnd a scar away from falling apart, apartBlood cells pixelate and eyes dilateAnd the full moon pills got me out on the street at nightCut it loose, watch you work the roomCut it loose, watch you work the roomCut it loose, watch you work the roomCut it loose, watch you work the room
I wrote a goodbye noteIn lipstick on your arm when you passed outI couldn't bring myself to callExcept to call it quitsBest friendsEx-friends till the endBetter off as loversAnd not the other way aroundRacing through the city.Windows down in the back ofYellow-checkered carsYou're wrongAre we all wrong?You're wrongAre we all wrong?This city saysCome hell or high waterWhen I'm feeling hot and wetI can't commit to a thing
The D.A. is dressed to the ninesIn the mirror he practices all his linesTo his closing argument, twelve hearts beat in favorI'm guessing that he read the morning paperThe headline reads "The Man Hangs," but the jury doesn'tAnd everyone's looking for reliefThe United States versus disbeliefMothers cast tears on both sides of the aisleClear your throat and face the worldThe verdict falls like bachelors for bad luck girlsOnly breathing with the aid of denialCase open, case shutBut you could pay to close it like a casketBaby boy can't lift his headache headIsn't it tragic? Whoa (Oh)

She was sixteen and six feet tallIn a crowd of teenagers coming out of the zooShe stumbled, started to slip and fallTeeter-tottered on the top of patent leather shoesI happened to catch her and said"Maybe these ruby shoes are a little cumbersome for you"Maybe for you, nowBut not as shaky as I must have seemedTalking junk through her giggle little teenage dreamAnd on the phone I could not competeMy dumb luck fake confidence was getting weakFor a sec', I thought I sounded sweetBut sure enough in a gruff, faint voiceI heard myself speakI could stay a while, but sooner or later I'll break your smile

You said I beganThis messy state of love affairAnd I drink too much and smoke too fastAnd this city's cleared my innocenceCoffee is pouring out my earsIt's the only thing they have in hereAnd my heart stops beatingAnd when it stops it stopsMy heart stopped beatingAnd when it stops it stopsMy heart stopped beatingNumber tree still on my plate

My debut is coming soonYou already know what I'm gonna doYou got my time on the dotted lineBut you show up invited and before I signAnd someone say I'm not making mistakesBut please don't be fakeMy debut comes todayAnd my feelings have all run awayWith the man that I am but understandHey, if I don't keep going it'll just go to showThat I've been beat by an industry I've never seenThis is me on my kneesSinging take it all from me, take it allSpeak to my needs, my needs
Still waters, heavy heartsPlans we make all fall apartDisillusioned and lost in the grayHow can we fix the heart when it breaksDon't know how much more you can takeJust give it timeIt's gonna get betterNow is not forever at allJust give it timeEverything changesTomorrow comes today will be goneEverything's gonna be alrightJust give it time, Give it time
It's you to meYour gentle faceOverdue, worth the waitAnd out of my reachBut I'm reaching out for youMe to the nightI say goodbyeThe time is upI fight the timeA needed awardI can't affordA finished song
Can you tell me how we got in this situationI can't seem to get you off my mindAll these ups and downsThey trip up our good intentionsNobody said this was easy an ride.After all, we're only humanAlways fighting what we're feelingHurting, instead of healingAfter all, we're only humanIs there any other reason why weStay instead of leaving, after all?Can we get back to the point of this conversationWhen we saw things through each other's eyes'Cause now all I see is ruin and devastationWe all need someplace we can hide inside
I'm glad i never lived next to the waterSo I could never get used to the beachAnd I'm glad I never grew up on a mountainTo figure out how high the world could reachI love the miles between me and the cityWhere I quietly imagine every streetAnd I'm glad I'm only picturing the momentI'm glad she never fell in love with meFor some the world's a treasure to discoverAnd your scenery should never stay the same
She don't know you but she swear she knows your typeGot a mouth full of opinions and most are wrongBut they all sound rightAnd the ring around her finger is only there for make youWish you were the one for herSo I'm praying to keep me from breakingFrom being another loser helpless at her sideAnd it's crazy, it's like no one can save me this timeShe's got me praying to the wrong god every nightPraying to the wrong god every night
I used to stare up into the sky,And fill the space around with my why'sBut now I've got it all figured out,And I'm embarrassed that it took me 'til now,The simple answers in her repliesUnlock the universe with her eyes,She rips apart my world with her moves,Oh, while stealing all the light in the roomAnd I found someone to walk me through this lifeThe brightest sun has opened up my eyesTonight I need exactly who she is
Fourth floor lonely Juanita sits there staring at the screenTypes in, "Can anybody tell me what it all means?"Tick-tock waiting for an answer, it's no useThen all at once to her surprise she gets one replyUntil you got loveYou know you got nothingYou're missing that somethingThat's gonna set you freeUntil you got loveYou'll always be runningLove is that one thingThat everybody needsSunday, no one's at the office just Ray at his father's desk

It's been so long ~ I should be used to this by nowLoneliness that keeps comin back aroundThe moon on my window, oh casts a different lightOn all these memories that keep me up tonightHey I know just what I needThats you and in a hurryIf I got on the road right nowI'd see ya at 4: 30...Hey I...Think I have about ~ Sixty miles of gasoline left in my carTheres an all night truck stop ~ Yeah bet I could get that far
I remember the windows rolled down and the wind in my hairDriving 'round in your Daddy's old ChevyLike we were going somewhereWe thought that summer would last us foreverGoing steady was just something you doI didn't know much about loveI learned that from youNow those were some good timesLately they don't seem to lastI guess I'm not nearly as strong as a drink in your glassAnd the nights just get laterI can stay up and wait or just go on to bed like I doI never knew nothing 'bout lonelyI learned from that you

Last night, last night I awoke up from a dreamCame face to face with my face facing the tombstone teethOf a man called Chiklets, he came down through the agesWith the desperate beauty of a middleweight boxerHe came beating the force field with the elegant graceHe was, he was trying to get a perfect gripBut there was no absolute gripHe was in a sailboat, in a glass bottom boatAnd the bottom of a boatHe was coming down through the ages
Nodding though the lamp's lit lowNod for passers undergroundTo and fro she's darningAnd the land is weeping red and paleWeeping yarn from AlgiersWeeping yarn from AlgiersWeaving though the eyes paleWhat will rend will also mendThe sifting cloth is bindingAnd the dream she weaves will never end

Amanda, I know what you're thinking,You and I have much to say,And you've been making me crazy,Trying to understandBut it's impossible at your age.I know I said I'll always try,But you're going to bed alone again tonight,And you lie there in the dark and wonder why.I did it for you, and the boys,Because love should teach you joy,And not the imitation,That your momma and daddy tried to show you.I did it for you, and for me,And because I still believe,There's only one thing,You can never give up,Never compromise on,
Call you up in the middle of the nightLike a firefly without a lightYou were there like a blowtorch burnin'I was a key that could use a little turnin'So tired that I couldn't even sleepSo many secrets I couldn't keepPromised myself I wouldn't weepOne more promise, I couldn't keepIt seems no one can help me nowI'm in too deep, there's no way outThis time I have really led myself astrayRunaway train, never goin' backWrong way, on a one way trackSeems like I should be gettin' somewhere

Ten years ago, on a cold, dark nightThere was someone killed 'neath the town hall lightThere were few at the scene, but they all agreedThat the slayer who ran looked a lot like meThe judge said, "Son what is your alibi?If you were somewhere else, then you won't have to die"I spoke not a word, though it meant my lifeFor I had been in the arms of my best friend's wife

Climbing a mountainIn darknessStranded alone on the ledge.Every attempt that I make to hold onPushes me nearer the edge.Sensing the changes impendingMy thoughts are diffused by despairI feel like I'm swimming straight upUnderwaterDesperately racing for airI'm racing for air.And the chords struck at birthGrow more distant
I hear the drums echoing tonightBut she hears only whispers of some quiet conversationShe's coming in, 12:30 flightThe moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvationI stopped an old man along the wayHoping to find some long forgotten words or ancient melodiesHe turned to me as if to say, "Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you"It's gonna take a lot to take me away from youThere's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever doI bless the rains down in AfricaGonna take some time to do the things we never had
You and your babyHad some words todayTil not another wordWas left to sayI see that grin, boyMaybe you think you'll win, boyUntil the sun goes downAnd once again, boyOne lonely nightOne lonely nightThat's all it takes toCompletely break you

If I cried out loudAll the sorrows I've KnownAnd the secrets I've heardIt would ease my mindSomeone sharing the loadBut I won't breathe a wordWe're two of a kindSilence and IWe need a chance to talk things overTwo of a kindSilence and IWe'll find a way to work it out
I know you're disappointed in the way I handled thingsYou're thinking I misread the times and acted cowardlyAnd since what I do affects us bothAnd you feel that I let you downYou're paying a price when there is no price to payLovers trust, no money downYou're paying a price when there is no price to payIt's a lovers trust, no money down(Hey! lover)(Hey! lover)(Lover)They say there's someone for everyoneAnd for everyone a someoneAnd some tattoo roses across their chestsWith a heart that says Rollo

When we lift the covers from our feelingsWe expose our insecure spotsTrust is just as rare as devotionForgive us our cynical thoughts.If we need too much attentionNot content with being coolWe must throw ourselves wide openAnd start acting like a foolIf we need too much approvalThen the cuts can seem too cruel.Right to the heart of the matterRight to the beautiful partIllusions are painfully shatteredRight where discovery starts
Tough times demand tough talkDemand tough heartsDemand tough songsDemand tough talkDemand tough heartsDemand tough songsDemand.We can rise and fall like empiresFlow in and out like the tideBe vain and smart, humble and dumbWe can hit and miss like prideJust like pride.We can circle around like hurricanesDance and dream like loversAttack the day like birds of preyOr scavengers undercover.Look inTo the eye of the stormLook outFor the force without form

Reflecting on what's beenThough past will be futureWhen again yesterday to be madeFor me hazy times fume all aroundBurning grass in a field of endless suppliesTall people casting shadows on the shortLittle people running circles round the wideLazy times waste it wellWhat better to do with my mind!Crazy times no rhythm too hard
So few wordsSo few wordsWe are movin' round to the hourForce from the powerThunder reigns down in a mass mind showerLevellin' vibes unravellin' scribesTake a venomous sting that's unsettlin'But consequences awaits me around the cornerReminiscent of my twistin' fateAll down to the fact it's a hard lifeTravel on with the sense of a telling adventureSo as I wait for the opportune time to createSoul energy that will then enable me to realiseAnalyse all aspect of man-made decisionThe vision the many waysWrong turn right, right turn... leftAin't no way back straight ahead along trackCounteract react higher pace embrace
Energy from every poreMake what you willAre you with or without?The force cannot be blamedJust the hunger or greedSupplying the ugly driveDiirty water no profit to supply

Almost heaven, West JamaicaTrue ridge mountains, shining down the riverAll my friends there, older than those ridgeYounger than the mountains, blowin' like a breezeCountry roads take me homeTo the place I belongWest Jamaica, my ol' mommaTake me home country roadsI heard her voice, in the mornin' hour she calls meSaid "Son you remind me of my home far away"
The one who survives by making the livesOf others worthwhileShe's coming apartRight before my eyesThe one who depends on the services she rendersTo those who come knockingShe's seeing too clearly what she can't beWhat understanding defiesShe says I need not to needOr else a love with intuitionSomeone who reaches out to my weakness and won't let goI need not to needI've always been the towerBut now I feel like I'm the flower trying to bloom in snowShe turns out the light, anticipating nightFalling tenderly around her
Why am I walking barefootUpon this road with no one aroundI close my eyes to this decisionThe night's like coffee to my tongueLike waking up without a soundI map the words outMaybe you will say themWould you help me rise upTouch my face and watch me try to breathe againWould you let me do thisBurn down the final wallOvercome me babyOvercome me baby
Well it's you and it's meMe with a drink in my handThe ice is tinkling like a wind chimeAnd late afternoon settles over the landAnd you're talking about thingsInteresting just slightlyAnd things that matter too muchTo say any way but lightlyDid you know you're so beautifulOn the edge of summerThat years from now
We are not together hereThough we lie entwinedTo make room for the other presenceWe both draw back in our mindsI have a prophecyThreatening to spill into wordsThis growing certaintyOf OverThere once was a time I was sure of the bondWhen my hands and my tongue and my thoughts were enoughWe are the same but our lives move along
Everyone agrees it came too soonIt was only meant to be an intersectionYou kept fear of death in back pocket of your jeansIn the palm of your hand, affectionIt came like a sudden gust of windLeaving them, bewildered, to ask howI recall last time we met you said we'd meet againThe irony is only bitter nowThese days everyone cries, "say uncle"They want to touch your spirit lest it dieFor this your sons and widow gather with us at the tableTo form a healing circle for our new demiseThese days everyone cries, "say uncle"I retrieve the memories quickly as I can
I'm at your back doorWith the earth of a hundred nations in my skinYou wouldn't recognize meFor the light in my eyes is strangeIt was years ago, god knowsWhen you strained to tell me your whole truthThat you were not mine to saveThat you could not changeWell, would it be enough to go byIf we could sail on the wind in the darkCut those chains in the middle of the nightThat had you pulled apartWould it be enough to go byIf there's moonlight pulling the tideWould it be enough to live onIf my love could keep you aliveI've built a lot of castlesI've built a lot of blazing speed-of-light machinesBut it doesn't matter, you knowThey all crumble in the winds of change
Strange how you know inside meI measure the time and I stand amazedStrange how I know inside youMy hand is outstretched toward the damp of the hazeAnd of course I forgiveI've seen how you liveLike a phoenix you rise from the ashesYou pick up the piecesAnd the ghosts in the atticThey never quite leaveAnd of course I forgiveYou've seen how I liveI've got darkness and fears to appeaseMy voices and analogiesAmbitions like ribbonsWorn bright on my sleeveStrange how we know each other
Once, when I was thirty-oneI woke in the dead of nightAnd heard the vastness of the snowfall outsideSlipped downstairs in my bare feetSoon forgotten freezingAnd poured a milk glass fullTo wait out the tideBeen a decade and oneBeen a decade and one, my friendsA decade and oneSince I...As the white went down
Over the past few yearsTo the traditional sounds of the English summerThe drone of lawnmowersThe smack of leather on willowHas been added a new noiseWhat were the skies like when you were young?They went on forever and they, when I, we lived in ArizonaAnd the skies always had little fluffy clouds in them and, er.They were long and clear and.There were lots of stars at nightAnd, er, when it would rain it would all turn, it, they were beautifulThe most beautiful skies, as a matter of factUh, the sunsets were.Purple and red and yellow and on fireAnd the clouds would catch the colors everywhereThat's neat, 'cause I used to look at them all the time when I was littleYou don't see that

We're here where the daylight beginsThe fog on the streetlight slowly thinsWater on water's the wayThe safety of shoreline fading awaySail your seaMeet your stormAll I want is to be your harborThe light in meWill guide you homeAll I want is to be your harborFear is the brightest of signsThe shape of the boundary you leave behind

Mission Street is a striking dark-eyed strangerWho speaks a language I don't know but long to learnIts cadences fall endlessly beyond the windowpaneAs I sit as though awaiting some returnAnd my hands are cold tonightI'm sleepless in this darkForgetting what it was I came to findAnd it seems that I've been wrongMore than I've been rightMore than I've been rightMission Street calls out to me by name
Inside the labyrinth wallsThere lies a tiny child who sleeps aloneAnd as the daylight fallsThe wind becomes so wild across the stoneFor I have made her prison beHer every step away from meAnd this child I would destroyIf you tried to set her free
So far, so goodYou're coming to the bend at the end of the roadYou put a hand to the belly that's foreign moreWith every day like an oversize loadAnd you're thinking about clouds the color of fireAnd the scent of an orange peelThe way Mount Shasta explodes into windshield viewAnd your hands steady on the wheelSo far, so goodCoffee motel coffee diner coffee, go onStyrofoam is drying like the tears that once did flowStarting 10 o'clock and ending at dawnAnd you can't go back but you're going backAnd you don't know what you'll sayYou've got half-formed sentences
It's desert ice outside, but this diner has thawed my earsHot coffee in a clean white mug and a smile when the waitress hearsThat I was born in North CarolinaNot an hour from her home townAnd we used to play the same pizza parlor pinballAnd there's a glance in time suspended as I wonder how it isWe've been swept up just by circumstance to where the coyote livesWhere my days are strips of highwayAnd she's wiping tables downHolding on and still waiting for that windfallBut I've come homeEven though I've never had so far to goI've come homeI pay the check and leave the change from a crumpled ten-dollar billHead across the street where VACANCY is burning in neon still
Anna Rose sleep well tonightThe stars are dancing on the carpet of the skyTime to close your wondering eyesWhere I see the sleepiness creepingAnna Rose it makes my heart smileTo know you give love so freelyAnna Rose it makes it worthwhile
I died in a car crash two days agoWas unrecognizableWhen they pulled me from the gearsNo one's fault, no one's bottleNo one's teenage pride or throttleOur innocence is all the worse for fearsThe other walked away aliveArms wrapped now around his wifeMy lover sits, the silent eyeIn a hurricane of warmth and wordMy mother trembles with the sobsWhose absence seems absurdMy sister shouts to let her seeThrough the cloud of crowd surrounding meMy colleagues call for silence in my nameI died in a car crash three months agoThey burned me 'til I glowedAnd crumbled to a fine gray sandNow I am nothing, everywhere
It's the season of grace coming out of the voidWhere a man is saved by a voice in the distanceIt's the season of possible miracle curesWhere hope is currency and death is not the last unknownWhere time begins to fadeAnd age is welcome homeIt's the season of eyes meeting over the noiseAnd holding fast with sharp realizationIt's the season of cold making warmth a divine interventionYou are safe here you know nowDon't forgetDon't forget I love
Don't hear, don't deemDrown in before you diveDon't care, commitTo your self destruction driveI kiss the ground withWith love beyond foreverFlip off the sky withWith bleeding fingers 'til I dieEnemy, take one good look at meEradicate what you will always beYour tainted flesh, polluted soulThrough a mirror I beholdThrow a punch, shards bleed on the floorTearing me apart but I don't care any more

I was looking at a photograph,Taken in a garden long before the war,And out on the lawn,There were old men and dogs and little children,All of them gone forever;There were people by the waterside,Standing in the same place where I am today;Nothing has changed - but you know,That time is moving like a river,It can only be love forever;We shine on, brighter than the sun,
Oh well a young man ain't got nothin' in the world these daysI said a young man ain't got nothin' in the world these daysYou know in the old daysWhen a young man was a strong manAll the people they'd step backWhen a young man walked by
Another day has triedTo make me olderAnother second has justCome and goneTime has wrapped it's armAround my shouldersAnd I'm chasing the sunWhile the moon's on the runThough I'm always told thatTime's a healerThe tickin' clock don't cureMy broken heartSand in my hand'Til this will be overGive me space to go on
(Chorus x15)Make you feel that way(Verse One)Up an early for the hope of a brand new daySee a homie you ain't seen since back in the dayFresh haircut fitted wit a fat ass fadeEnd of work, we chilling on a SaturdayHow you felt when you first heard the data cameRakim KRS hey I had that tapeCooling out with ol girl on a fat ass dateFind a hundred dollar bill wow man that's greatGet promoted at your job up to managementPlot a long time finally a plan has made itTime I feel I wanna shout, man its real that wayWanna think of things that make you feel that way(Chorus x15)(Verse Two)

If you want money in your pocketAnd a top hat on your headA hot meal on your tableAnd a blanket on your bedWell today is grey skiesTomorrow is tearsYou'll have to wait til yesterday is hereWell I'm going to New York CityAnd I'm leaving on a train
When I was just a kid, little childrenMy old man used to sing a litle songBut now I've grown to be a manBut it still lingers deep within my soulOh yes it lingers deep within my soulHe say now this train it is bound to glory, this trainThis train it is bound to glory this train, this trainThis train it is bound to glory, This train it don't carry no unholyThis train is bound to glory, this trainNow this train it don't carry no backsliders, this trainThis train don't carry no backsliders, this trainThis train it don't carry no backsliders this train only carrry JAH JAH childrenThis train it is bound to glory, this trainPlay a little song for me----
Raindrops keep fallin' on my headAnd just like the guy whose feet are too big for his bedNothin' seems to fitThose raindrops are fallin' on my head, they keep fallin'So I just did me some talkin' to the sunAnd I said I didn't like the way he got things doneSleepin' on the jobThose raindrops are fallin' on my head, they keep fallin'
I don't think you understandThat what your doing is not so coolYou think it's funny to mess with my mindDon't youYou know I like you so you just tease meYou give me just enoughTo hang on and onWhen your just wasting my timeYou're simply wasting my timeSo quit wasting my time
Crazy how time flies by so fastWe must all remember to enjoy the rideFor it's too late once you crashLife's gone in a flashLooking back through the yearsPhotographs and scrap books held dearRoller skates, sleeping bagsFirst bike, 12 stitches to matchI pick myself back up againDaydreamin's the way to visit the pastThose spaces and timesThat we'd all hope would forever last
My love, here I stand before youI am yours now from this moment onTake my hand, only you can stop me shakingWe'll share forever, this I promise youAnd when I look in your eyesAll of my life is before meAnd I'm not running anymore'Cause I already know I'm homeWith every beat of my heart
The song of a little birdThe joy in three little wordsI know it's realThis is how it feelsTo be loved by youThe stars from a midnight skyThe melody from a lullabyThere's nothing realThat I wouldn't steal
Yesterday I was on the edgeHoping everything was going to work itself outA good honest man doing the work of GodTrying to make things better for HimA lover of life in a school for foolsTrying to find another way to surviveNew Music, Music, New MusicSweet Music can lighten usCan brighten the world, can save usMy friend said well, I think I found a way
The hours, the minutes seem to flyAnd since the last goodbyeYou and I came a long wayThe nights, too short to fill with sleepOr falling in too deepSeem so far away nowMemories, all we share between usEverything we were, all that we remainBut memories somehow came between usBreaking up two minds that were one and the sameThe years are moments passing byNo time to wonder why
Show me a promised land and I will go anywhereAnd if you ask me to take my time I'll wait for yearsI'll hold on though the whole world tells me I'm wrongSomeday, somedayBut it seems so longAsk me to prove my love and I will do anything
I try to kill the painBut it keeps me in this circleIt's hard to get awayI feel you againYou're with meLove is a word you gave it a nameLove is right nowSo don't close your heartI've been waiting all my lifeFor the moment of our loveWith youI try to feel the pain

Go on to the street to the cars in the pouring rainGo on to the bus that left us in the dust and the flamesAnd when the son meets the fatherIt'll be something smarter for the painBut you will always be the sameYou will always be the same
Two hearts fading, like a flowerAnd all this waiting for the powerFor some answer to this fireSinking slowly, the water's higher... mmmDesireDesireWith no secrets, no obsession
I am a broken toyFor a lonely girlUse once and destroyAnd go find some moreBack home, kids play in the leaves in the parkShe wants to play a game of heartsI'm the rag doll boyWith broken eyes
Pulled into the stationAnd they're playing Waylon JenningsWhen you're driving through so late at nightYou'll see the lights are blindingYeah, and I'll be thinking of youHome, my baby's going homeMy baby's going homeTomorrowOoh
In CaliforniaForever summer and hotInto the oceanYou're smiling a lotOn sandy beachesAnd the blankets are hotYou're in my armsAnd I kiss your heart
Trouble in the air,I don't want it but I got to breatheIt's coming through the doorBehind the shadows that surround me when I sleepSomehow I know that I can't pray this awayI'll keep my head downAnd get up on this train, this train, ohI'm gonna ride this pain like a waveLord, make me over, I don't wanna be afraidAnd when my time is come and goneI don't wanna be the one who can't let goWhat if I get lost and I call out to you
You said it yourself - you can't help but flirt and I'd be the first to admit that I'm easily hurt.I can't take things lightly - you said I'm always in a huff.
If you learn to drive,I can use the train and the bus.When you're mobile, we'll go.Take my toys and your cat with us.We'll leave the violence,We'll have something to do.With a couch-bed in the front room for when we fall out or when our friends come through.
We're barely halfway there,You're stretched out and clamped around me.I don't think there's drink at home.You make a little snore and shift.Just keep your head down there - you sleep,I'll give directions.
There coming over Charaton BridgeLook, do you see the man who is poorBut rich?What do you wish and where do you go, who are you?Where are you from, will you tell me your name?Rest awhile, call me your friendPlease stay with me, I'd like to helpThen he saidHow can I speak when I'm dry and my throat is burning?
Two summers with the light onToo tired to fall asleepToo dumb to keep your clothes onToo cynical to speakIs there any wonder why I bother?Hanging round to take the painIs there any wonder why I bother?Hanging round for you to feel the sameCause in my world I couldnt waitTurn you round to your faceFor a timeFor a place to do you wrongSo get your gunsHer picture in your pocket
She doesn't know how to relaxDoesn't know how to hold backAnd all I can do is laughMaybe I'm too much in loveMaybe I don't give a fuckIt's never enoughAnd it's too lateI'm never around when your heart breaksNever allowed to make mistakesNow we're no longer just friends
War brought us togetherBlew the world apartYou handed me the daggerAimed towards your heartAnd I was laughingYour eyes were televisionsHigh above the staticI waited for an intermission
HeyYou're not the firstYou're not the lastTo hold me backYeahIt's such a shameIt's such a wasteTo hesitateNowI've seen the lightI've heard the soundOf bringing others downNot everyone deserves the sunNot everyone lives for too longNot everyone can turn you on
(I) I sit by my window with everything I've doneDoors that I've opened and webs that I've spunAnd the candle besides me burns to the leftAnd the rain on the clay sends the lizard to it's nestAnd there will be a time, that I hold you againWith my arms spread out, just you'll restAnd I'll write you a letter with everything I knowAbout the weight of the world and the way things could goSo live up my friend, step back againFor some things will be given, for some you'll have to bendYou'll have to bend my friend, to hold on to thisFor some things will come easy, and some will be a test
So now come sit downWill you talk with me nowLet me see through your eyesWhere there is so much lightWe are biding our timeFor these myths to unwindAll these changes we will confrontSo please bewareWith every place that you headLook to your soulFor these things that you knowFor the trees that we seeCannot forever breatheWith the changes they will confrontYou know some people they just won't understandNo they just won't understandThese thingsThank you for your message but I don't understandNo I just won't understandThese thingsAnd this sacred landIt has seen many handsIt has wealth and gold
It was a movement of the people, like many times before,Who stood up for peace and sat down for war.They ran from the ways, the old school waysFight those different, kill to be saved.These theories came straight from their minds,Their hearts left trembling, deep down insideWell i know, now know, i know, now know... what lies beneath...These views may change if we all walk this way
My baby don't care for showsMy baby don't care for clothesMy baby just cares for meMy baby don't care for cars and racesMy baby don't care for high-tone placesLiz Taylor is not his styleAnd even Lana Turner's smileIs somethin' he can't see
The name of this tune is Mississippi GoddamAnd I mean every word of itAlabama's gotten me so upsetTennessee made me lose my restAnd everybody knows about Mississippi GoddamAlabama's gotten me so upsetTennessee made me lose my restAnd everybody knows about Mississippi GoddamCan't you see itCan't you feel itIt's all in the airI can't stand the pressure much longerSomebody say a prayerAlabama's gotten me so upsetTennessee made me lose my restAnd everybody knows about Mississippi GoddamThis is a show tuneBut the show hasn't been written for it, yetHound dogs on my trailSchool children sitting in jailBlack cat cross my pathI think every day's gonna be my lastLord have mercy on this land of mineWe all gonna get it in due timeI don't belong hereI don't belong thereI've even stopped believing in prayer
Southern treesBarren strange fruitBlood on the leavesAnd blood at the rootsBlack bodiesSwinging in the southern breezeStrange fruit hangin'From the poplar trees
I had tender feelings that you made hardBut it's your heart, not mine, that's scarredSo when i go home, i'll be happy to goYou're just somebody that i used to knowYou don't need my help anymore
The imitation picks you up like a habitRiding in the glow of the TV staticTaking out the trash to the manGive the people something they understandMistake a nervous flash for a fine-line smileJunk bond trader trying to sell a sucker a stockRich man in a poor man's clothesThe permanent installment of the daily doseAnd you tell me, "fool, you tell it like it is"Your wall's gone wider than your head trip is
He held his breath to hold your handTo walk the stairsteps in pairsClimbing up a slippery slopeIm in love, love i hopeDont go home angelinaStay with me, hanging around the lost and foundKissed you quick feeling weird
You'll take advantage 'till you think you're being used'Cause without an enemy your anger gets confusedAnd I got stuck on a side you know I never choseBut it's all about taking the easy way out for you, I supposeThere's no escape for you, except in someone elseAlthough you've already disappeared within yourself
Hang on, got to goPreview what they oughta knowKeep your head down and fucking dieWake up, rise and shineGotta take another pintDig heads and watch out for the nightWhen the sun comes down and the moon gets up in the skyThe battle of the day and the night

Please accept my apologies, wonder what would have beenWould you have been a little angel? or an angel of sin?Tom-boy running around, hanging with all the guys?Or a little tough boy with beautiful brown eyes?Paid for the murder befor they had determined the sexChoosing our life over your life meant your deathAnd you never got a chance to even open your eyesSometimes I wonder as a fetus if you fought for your life?Would you have been a little genius, in love with math?Would you have played in your school clothes and made me mad?Would you have been a little rapper like your poppa the piper?Would you have made me quit smoking by finding one of my lighters?I wonder about your skintone and shape of your noseAnd the way you would have laughed and talked fast or slowI think about it every year, so I picked up a penHappy birthday, I love you whoever you would have beenWhat I thought was a dreamMake a wishWas as real as it seemed

I always believed in futuresI hope for better in NovemberI try the same losing lucky numbersIt could be a cold night for a lifetimeHey nowYou can't keep saying endlesslyMy darlingHow long 'til this affects me?Say hello to good timesTrade up for the fast rideWe close our eyes while the nickel and dimeTake the streets completely
I give myself some energyI took it from the shelfI'll make myself reanimateAnd turn awayI can see the road I'm running onIt's dangerous from the startThen my soul and my enemies were thrown awayWhat he doesn't knowI'm not going homeI'm not gonna stay this way againWhat he doesn't knowI'm not going home for daysIt took my soul from my canopyI knew it from the start
Everybody's Talkin'"Everybody's talkin' at meI don't hear a word they're sayin'Only the echoes of my mindPeople stopping, staringI can't see their facesOnly the shadows of their eyesI'm going where the sun keeps shining
If you only once would let meOnly just one timeThen be happy with the consequenceWith whatever's gonna happen tonightDon't think we're not seriousWhen's it ever not?The love we make is give and it's takeI'm game to play alongAll I can sayI shouldn't sayCan we take a ride?Get out of this place while we still have time

I don't feel the way I've ever feltI knowI'm gonna smile and not get worriedI try but it showsAnyone can make what I have builtAnd better nowAnyone can find the same white pillsIt takes my pain awayIt's a lie, a kiss with open eyesAnd she's not breathing backAnything but bother me(It takes my pain away)Nevermind these are horrid timesOh, oh, ohI can't let it bother me

I was under the Calvary CrossThe pale-faced lady she said to meI've watched you with my one green eyeAnd I'll hurt you 'till you need meYou scuff your heels and you spit on your shoesYou do nothing with reasonOne day you catch a trainNever leaves the station
You gas her upYou're behind the wheelYour arm around your sweet oneIn your OldsmobileBarrelin' down the boulevardLooking for the heart of Saturday nightGot paid on FridayYour pockets are jinglingYou see the lightsYou get all tinglin', 'cause you're cruising with a sixLooking for the heart of Saturday night
You must be out thereEvery time I've got an hour on my handsI hope you feel meEvery now and then I understand the factThat you believed meHow can I go on?If you don't come along to set me offI don't know nothing, no, noHow can I move on?When I am half as strong without your strengthI don't know nothingOh, oh, 'cause you're not in my world to ease my worriesAnd you can't be the one I turn to
I've seen your face a thousand timesHave all your stories memorizedI've kissed your lips a million waysBut I still love to have you aroundI've held you too many times to countI think I know you inside outAnd we're together most daysBut I still love to have you aroundAnd you're the one I want and it's not just a phaseAnd you're the one I trust, our love is the real thingDon't go awayMy love (my love)I want you to stayIn my lifeDon't go awayMy lover (my love)I'm happiest when we spend time
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone.It's not warm when she's away.Ain't no sunshine when she's goneAnd she's always gone too longAnytime she goes away.Wonder this time where she's gone,Wonder if she's gone to stayAin't no sunshine when she's goneAnd this house just ain't no home
For 27 years I've been trying to believe and confide inDifferent people I've found.Some of them got closer then othersSome wouldn't even bother and then you came aroundI didn't really know what to call you, you didn't know me at allBut I was happy to explain.I never really knew how to move youSo I tried to intrude through the little holes in your veinsAnd I saw youBut that's not an invitationThat's all I getIf this is communicationI disconnectI've seen you, I know youBut I don't know
It takes no match to give me a sparkNow I'm trying out another heartI've been whining 'bout a fresh startI've found myself a good horseI spurred it over quicksandAnd I ran it through the hollow landI've fed it with a shaky handI found myself a strong horseThese are the promises I can keep
Man, I've had a fewBut they wouldn't quite blow me like youYou gave me your name and signedWith a halo around my eyeAnd it hit me like never beforeThat love is a powerful forceYes, it struck me that love is a sportSo I pushed you a little bit moreLove, you're news to meYou're a little bit more than I thought you'd beA mole in my well-fed lawnYou're a nightmare beating the dawnOh, it hit me like never beforeThat love is a powerful forceYes, it struck me that love is sportSo I pushed you a little bit moreBlue, blue, black and blue
Oh my heart can't carry much moreIt's really, really aching and soreMy heart don't care anymoreI really can't bear moreMy hands don't work like beforeI shiver and I scrape at your doorMy heart can't carry much moreBut you couldn't care lessCould youYour face don't look like beforeIt's really not like yours anymoreYour eyes don't like me no more
With a sampled heartbeat and a stolen soulI sold my songs to have my fortune toldAnd it saidYou should know that love will never dieBut see how it kills you in the blink of an eyeI know love is a hot white lightIt knocks you down and then leaves you dryOh how can it be sweet mama tell me whyWhy all loves disciples have to wither and diePlease sister, help me come on do what you shouldPlease give me something I'm not doing so goodI'm gone, done wrong is there nothing you can say
I went too far, yes I came too closeI drove away the one that I loved the mostNow I ride the tight on a boat made of sandI'm sailing for another to guide me to landAnd lead me into the nightPlease drive away the lightCause I've been blinded by glitter and goldMy eyes need to rest from this lightAnd sleep well at nightI traveled east and I traveled westAnd I found a boy with a heart on his chest
So you trying to do what they didYour friends that turn to liquidAnd got lost in the seaAnd now you're drowning meWith your talk of four leaf cloversYou turn to rocks and omenTo beat the ambient harmBut it's bruising your karmaOh I wish my arms were widerI wish that I could hide you
Hold me, don't ever leave meKnow me, never believe meStay here but don't get too near meLeave me, leave me aloneBut don't ever let me goShow me but don't ever teach meTouch me, don't try to reach meHold me but don't ever keep meBaby, don't ever let me inAnd don't let me win'Cause I leave myself to youYes, I release myself with youI believe in me and youSo don't ever say you do

"This is a special moment right now.We'd like to take this time to tell all the kids at home, send the parents out of the room, this is a kids' song."Life's gonna suck when you grow up,When you grow up, when you grow upLife's gonna suck when you grow up,It sucks pretty bad right now"Hey, if you know the words, sing along!"You're gonna have to mow the lawn,Do the dishes, make your bedYou're gonna have to go to schoolUntil you're seventeen"It's gonna seem about three times as long as that."
Diamonds, roses, I need MosesTo cross this sea of loneliness, part this red river of painI don't necessarily buy any key to the future or happinessBut I need a little place in the sun sometimes or I think I will dieBut everywhere is somewhere and nowhere is nearEverybody got somebody with their wine and their beerSo I'm just this tragic figure in the corner over hereWith an empty apartment and a best friend who is queer
You were so cruelI hated being your foolSo I got a little bit more mud on my faceBut the years will bringA bigger scheme of thingsAnd make a pretty memory out of my disgraceI don't believe there is such a thing as saying too muchThere are those who like to look and those who ain't afraid to touchOh baby don't you know that theTime will do the talkingYears will do the walkingI'll just find a comfy spot and wait it outTime will do the talkingYears will do the walkingTime will tell you baby what you can't hear nowWell we dig our heels in
"You know you've done enough when every bone is soreYou know you've prayed enough when you don't ask anymoreYou know you're coming to some kind of understandingWhen every dream you've dreamed has passed and you're still standingMama says God tends to every little skinny sheepSo count your ribs and say your prayers and get to sleepNothing is louder to god's ears than a poor man's sorrowDaddy is poor today, and he will be poor tomorrowHey, that's the poor man's houseEverybody get a look at the poor man's houseEverywhere they went before must have turned them outAnd now they're living in a poor man's house
Sweet Lorraine, the fiery-haired and brown-eyed schemerWho came from a long line of drinkers and dreamersWho knew that sunshine don't hold up to darkWhose businesses fail, who sleep in the parkLorraine who spoke of paintings in ParisAnd outlandish things to her family just to scare usWhose heart went pokin' where it shouldn't ought toWhose mother could only spit at the thought ofLorraine, sweet Lorraine
Lord I feel like going homeI tried and I failed and I'm tired and wearyEverything I ever done was wrongAnd I feel like going homeLord I tried to see it through
That cold north wind they call " la bise "Is swirling round about my knees,Trees are crying leaves into the river;I'm huddled in this french cafe,I never thought I'd see the day,But winter is here and summer's really over,Even the birds have packed up and gone,They're flying south with their song,And my love, she too has gone, she had to fly,Take care, it's such a lonely sky,They'll trap your wings my love and hold your flight,They'll build a cage and steal your only sky,
You left it, I sent it, I want it backYou left it, I sent it, I want it backIf I had you here I'd clip your wingsSnap you up and leave you sprawlin' on my pinBut this plan of mine is oh, so very lameAnd can't you see the grass is greener where it rains?You left, I died, I went and you criedYou came, I think but I never really knowI've served my time, I've watched you climbThe wrong incline but what do I knowAccept it, don't let it turn the screw
I'll finish this jigsawI'll find the pieces behind the couchI dream we were slow dancingI dream I knew your nameBetween sleep and wakingWe're drinking flavored vodka in bedAnd when I wakeI'm all the King's horses and all King's men
Out into pitch blackWhere the moon lay upon its backDriving deep into the throatOf the countrysideStrapped tight intoCentre of sceneStarry open attic nightNo headline hits happen hereAbout what do I write
I looked in the skyWhere an elephant's eyeWas looking at meFrom a bubblegum treeAnd all that I knew wasThe hole in my shoeWhich was letting in water (letting in water)I walked through a field
Everybody's got a hungerNo matter where they areEverybody clings to their own fearEverybody hides some scarPrecious painEmpty and cold but it keeps me aliveI gave it my soul so that i could surviveKeeping me safe in these chainsPrecious pain

I've been keeping busy since we've said goodbyeBut all I do is think about youThe days are quick, the nights are longI feel them tick, I watch them crawlI'm petrified of running out of things to do'Though I've never really been in loveI know now what it meansTo miss someoneI have not been winning since we've said goodbye

This is the place where she lay her headWhen she went to bed at nightAnd this is the place our children were conceivedCandles lit the room brightly at nightAnd this is the place where she cut her wristsThat odd and fateful nightAnd I said, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, what a feeling
One too many goalsThat measure out your worthTo seek your weight in goldSat by the ivory sillThe further out you lookThe further out you'll beIt's not enough to set the termsIf nothing ventured, nothing earnedThough odds are set against
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)Spending timeConvinced that it's mine with herJust to keep her out of mindStill I'll take care to seeWhich way the wind blowsNotice how her hair curls
I bet you're wondering how I knewThat this would come to an endHe stole your heart from youSo you tossed me out to the windI keep pretending not to careBut the winter scent in her hairCompels my hands to doThe things my heart wouldn't dare
Our lips shouldn't touch(Move over darling)I like it too much(Move over darling)That gleam in your eyes is no big surprise anymore'Cause you fooled me beforeI'm all in a spin(Move over darling)About to give in(Move over darling)And though it's not right, I'm too weak to fight it somehow'Cause I want you right nowThe way you sigh, has me waving my conscience bye-byeYou can call me a fickle thing
I wanna go to bedWith arms around meBut wake up on my ownPretend that I'm still sleepingTill you go homeI can't look at you this morningI should probably have a signThat says, 'Leave right now or quicker'You've overstayed your timeIf I don't believe in loveNothing will last for meIf I don't believe in loveNothing is safe for meWhen I don't believe in loveYou're too close to meAnd that's why you have to leaveMaybe I slept peaceful on your shoulderYour arm warm around my side
I could put it down to being tiredOr coming home to an empty houseA passing momentA little manNo one around to stop me writing to youI never wanna say it's loveBut it's really what I'm thinking ofI could apologizeAnd say "tear it upAnd put it down to the pills I've taken"Seeing my friends with their lives moved onWell, I've been gently driftingI never wanna say it's loveBut it's really what I'm thinking of
Somedays I want loveSomedays I don'tSometimes I can feel itThen suddenly it's goneSomedays I can tell you the truthAnd somedays I just don'tOnly a change of mood, sun goes downSomeone says something too quick or too soonA touch not made, one made too lateArmies of words cannot hope to containThat it comes and it goesAnd I have no controlSomedays I can think clear
Let's pretend that we'll be here tomorrowAnd I'll try for you to be a little more on timeI know you need to say you know you've let me downBut you haven't and it's hard to talk with people all aroundPlease don't say how proud you areLet's do the things we normally doI'll say see you later you'll sing a line or twoFrom your rebel songs sung out of tuneDon't hold my hand for longer than you need toLet's forget that we're here and make some plansWe'll go for walks sit together on the bench we always satI'll tell you every little detail of my day and so will youBut don't try to stay awake, I'm feeling tired too
Read from start to endAnd againOh, the fearlessness of thoughts in printStrips the chord of a sensible wordAnd what's worse?She left her markIndelibleOh the nature of her scripted verseKeeps my eyesSet on the pageAnd it saysFrankly dear I'm forced to give it up
Leave the body, leave the mindLeave the body, leave the mindEvery promise every place behindI just happend to feel so aloneFor today for all days to comeI just wanna be wanna be goneI just wanna be wanna be goneLeave the quiet, leave the nightLeave the quiet, leave the nightBroken feelings of dreams out of sight
Me and youI better laugh in 20 years from nowWith some perspective and dedicationI will find somebody newIt better be someone specialHe Better be coming very soonIt better be for real this timeOh I know, it always was with youYou or no oneI hope I'm wrong before I die of boredom
Forever lost in 90 daysFrom early march till late in mayThen i pulled out in a dayTo catch my breath some place far awayAll to say farewell for nowNo one brings you down like iAll to say farewell for nowNo one brings you down like i

In the moment I was losing my headReading too muchAnd losing my headAnd I was reaching forwardI was already thereReading too muchAnd losing my headThis information caused a cut in the lineNow I'm remembering God and reading too muchIt's so niceThe print is smaller than the ants in the grassI'll have to put it away nowIn the morning there are things to be readAnd words to be said, and food to be fedBut I won't be thereI'll be clutching on a megaphonePointed at my headCould you be there, would you kindlyScream this word for word so loud and clear
If time can break us downAnd not keep us aroundI wont waitI wont mindNot this timeI've started up the clocksIt's time I left behindAnd everything we've lost, disappearsI'm calling, I'm calling outFor answers on the long walk homeI've started up the raceIt's something I cant change
She smokes like an amethystMoving her way through my skinShe moves meCause East is the way I goBut nobody seems to notice how I feelKeep all the lights offAnd I'll try to kill our past timeJust to find your heart
While she lays sleepingI stay out late at night and play my songsAnd sometimes all the nights can be so longAnd it's good when I finally make it homeAll aloneWhile she lays dreamin'I touch her face across the silver lightI see her dreams that drift up to the skyAnd she wakes up to my kissAnd I say it's alrightAnd I hold her tightAnd she believes in meI'll never know just what she sees in meI told her someday, if she was my girlI could change the worldWith my songs, I was wrong
When I go to sleep I prayI'm waking up to I got you, babeLike the guy from Groundhog DayJust wanna live forever this wayFlash back to seventeenI got my ass kicked by the football teamAnother loser on the sceneEditor of the chess club FanzineI asked you out for losing truth or dareThe guys were cracking up 'til you said yeahPinch me, is this real?I'm on a one way ticket out of LoservilleNow I'm off the social flat lineThings are so good that I'mTaking down my star trek shrineAnd you're more than just my valentineYou're my ticket outta Loserville

Cut this picture into you and meBurn it backwards, kill this historyMake it over, make it stay awayOr hate'll sing the ending that love started to sayThere's a kid a floor below me saying"Brother, can you spare
Everybody knows which way you goStraight to overNo one wants to see you inside of meStraight to overI heard the hammer at the lockSay you're deaf and dumb and done
I'll tell you why IDon't want to know where you areI got a joke I've beenDying to tell youA silent kid is lookingDown the barrelTo make the noise that IKept so quietKept it from you, Pitseleh

Never owned a brand new carNever worked in a white collarNever held a woman longerThan I held one single dollarI never went out chasin' rainbows'Cause there can't be that much to itEven if I found my pot of goldI'd probably piss right through itI can't remember ever wantingFor one second of my lifeEven if I did it cost too muchTo ever pay the priceI don't dance out on the dark sideAin't no secrets I have to tell
I took her daddy's old two-horse trailerI patched a place in the floor that was bareAnd we loaded up her barrel ponyAnd a riggin' bag's all that I hadLeft with our suitcases filled with desireFour hundred dollars, two good spare tiresNow our windshield's a painting that hangs in our roomThat changes with each mile like a radio tune
Party's overI just watched my girlfriend get laid on the sofaDoes that seem weird to you?The guy was olderHeard someone say he got her clothes off playing pokerWhen I wasn't in the roomCan I assume this spells the end for me and you?Morning afterI go outside and the garden's a disasterThe kitchen table's in the poolThe sound of laughterEchoes on inside my mind, holes in the plasterAnd I feel like such a toolAnd so abused, don't think I've ever felt this usedAnd goodbyeFeels so soreMy relationship's over
I'm hiding in a bush outside your windowI'm feeling sick and numbFed all my best lines to my best friendSo he could be the oneBut I'm a jerk, because it workedAnd I've just realised what I've doneGuess I'll never be the guy to get the girlSet it up so that he could rock your worldPromise me when you scream, you fake itHolly, I'm the one you should be datingSeeing you with him is so frustratingI taught him everything he knowsYou fell for every single line I gave himI know that I'm dumb, but Holly, I'm the one (Holly, I'm theOne)
You got the world boyThis all you make it?You had the choice ladYou wouldn't take itThe oldest charmOnly the best for youAnd the years of my life,Some they were so good,But now and again I feelI was a cowardAre the holes in my soulIn tatters for all these tearsWell you don't see it that wayA way, a wayWe'lll have it todayThe dancing ones they really mean itBut something boy,Something's gonna changeA way, a way
Bet you don't know you stole my heart awayBet you cant tell that I'm under your spellHaven't a clue what you do to meThat I long to be more than friendsLong to be more than a friendInnocently you came to me one dayYou didn't mean to make me feel this way
I knew all alongThat I was right at the startBout the seeds of the weedsThat grew in your heartSelf satisfaction for the factionsWho formed to tear us apartWell I gave you the Midas touchOh you turned round and scratched out my heartOh what did you expect?Oh tell me what did you expect?To lay it on my headSo is it all upon my head?Bang bang you're dead
She could never ever ever ever ever ever ever get it into her thick headSo when pretending ends shell have scattered her friendsAnd she'll find she'll wake up deadThere's no card above receiversStill it's all so remoteBehind the bench at the recWhere she lost fifty notes(She says) "I used to have a futureBut now I don't knowJust dependence and repentance and a ready-brek glow"Just put your money inBruised and battered shinsYou fucking love itYou fucking love itBack on your feet againOut on the beat again,You fucking love it
I don't believe in anythingThey tell me's set in stoneThey say that were togetherBut I'm sat here on my ownIn the company of strangersThis trigger happy sceneWell if a heart do like a hindThen there is nothing in-betweenOh no, no I don't mindOh no, no I don't mindCause I can call someone to bring the fight on(The doctors and the dealers)Get someone to shed some light on(Miracle cure, soul stealers)Crack pot quacks with cracked up egos(Prescribing old placebos)Collecting junk that we dont need, noI see them now and thenStill spitting out those liesStrange it doesn't bother me
Run they said to a promised landRun and find us a helping handDon't come back till the sun is goneDon't come back till the war is wonWe all set out with our hearts in handA cold wind covered up a line in the sandAll so youngNothing to losePieces of silver and a dead mans shoesAnd oh do you know what I'm sayingStrike a light to guide usSomewhereTempest swells our worlds collideArrows from above and the salt in our eyesThen as the sky began to bruise
The moment I wake upBefore I put on my make-upI say a little prayer for youWhile combing my hair nowAnd wond'ring what dress to wear nowI say a little prayer for youForeverAnd everYou'll stay in my heartAnd I will love youForeverAnd everWe never will partOh, how I'll love youTogetherForeverThat's how it must be.To live without youWould only mean heart break for meI run for the bus, dearWhile riding I think of us dear

There's a part of the country could drop off tomorrow in an earthquake,Yeah it's out there on the cutting edge, the people move, the sidwalks shake.And there's another part of the country with a land that gently creaks and thuds,Where the heavy snows make faucets leak in bathrooms with free-standing tubs.They're in houses that are haunted, the with kids who lie awake and think aboutAll the generations past who used to use that dripping sink.And sometimes one place wants to slip into the other just to seeWhat it's like to trade its demons for the restless ghost of Mrs. Ogilvey,She used to pick the mint from her front yard to dress the Sunday pork,Sometimes southern California wants to be western New York.It wants to have a family business in sheet metal or power tools,

I don't go to therapy to find out if I'm a freakI go and I find the one and only answer every weekAnd it's just me and all the memories to followDown any course that fits within a fifty minute hourAnd we fathom all the mysteries, explicit and inherentWhen I hit a rut, she says to try the other parentAnd she's so kind, I think she wants to tell me something,But she knows that its much better if I get it for myself...And she saysWhat do you hear in these sounds?What do you hear in these sounds?I say I hear a doubt, with the voice of true believingAnd the promises to stay, and the footsteps that are leavingAnd she says "Oh," I say, "What?" she says, "Exactly,"I say, "What, you think I'm angryDoes that mean you think I'm angry?"
Well we're heading for a past that you leave not defendWhere the downtowns hold the sadness of you can't go back againIt's there you'll find the rust and debtorsMotel signs with missing lettersCause there's a monster on the outskirtsSays it knows what your town needsThen it eats it up like nothing and it won't spit out the seedsAnd we can be the super shoppersWe can say we're really smartWe can say our town is doing fine without a beating heartWe can even say the money saved is all our ownIt's bought and sold, it's bought and soldAnd we're heading for a nasty business, keeps our country growingWhere the weapons that we're selling are the only seeds we're sowing

On this dawn the colours of the autumn are reflected by a lightA light that as been captured for years in oblivionCircles of wind are raging nowAnd so his powers are slowly dyingBefore the coldness rapes the landsHis spirit is wandering into the night... to DIE!...and he heard chimes ahead playing these enchanted notes,That lead him to a wooden cabin, where he could rest for the night...
It's how high you are and the time it takes to healIt's how high you are and the time it takes to healI can climb a tree and push up through the leaves'Cause only when I try am I happier to seeMy head's in some kind of space where boyhood used to beIt's how high you are and the time it takes to healIt's how high you are and the time it takes to healBut it's all a lie and I've never felt so sadThere's a streak of melancholy running down my backAnd there's a great mistrust that borders round the man

Take an eye for an eyeTake a tooth for a toothJust like they say in the bibleNever leave a trace or forget a faceOf any man at the tableWhen the moon is a cold chiseled daggerSharp enough to draw blood from a stoneHe rides through your dreams on a coach and horsesAnd the fence posts in the moonlight look like bonesWell they've stopped trying to hold himWith mortar, stone and chainHe broke out of every prisonBoots mount the staircase
When I'm lyin' in my bed at nightI don't wanna grow upNothin' ever seems to turn out rightI don't wanna grow upHow do you move in a world of fogThat's always changing thingsMakes me wish that I could be a dogWhen I see the price that you payI don't wanna grow upI don't ever wanna be that wayI don't wanna grow upSeems like folks turn into thingsThat they'd never wantThe only thing to live forIs today...

Crest fallen sidekick in an old cafeNever slept with a dream before he had to go awayThere's a bell in the towerUncle Ray bought a roundDon't worry about the armyIn the cold cold groundNow don't be a cry babyWhen there's wood in the shedThere's a bird in the chimmneyAnd a stone in my bedWhen the road's washed outThey pass the bottle aroundAnd wait in the armsOf the cold cold groundCold cold groundThere's a ribbon in the willowAnd a tire swing rope
The bats are in the belfryThe dew is on the moorWhere are the arms that held meAnd pledged her love beforeAnd pledged her love beforeChorus:It's such a sad old feelingThe fields are soft and green
I'm not your doormat, your floormatSo don't wipe your feet on meI'm not the only garibaldiThere's more fish in the seaI'm not your puppy, nor goldfishSo don't treat me like your petI'm not your butterfly, so don't tryTo chase me with your net I'm not your kneaded eraserSo don't you wear me downI'm not your sledge, sledge hammerI'm no tool, that you poundI'm not your blacktop, for hopscotchSo don't jump all over meI'm not the place where the dogs roamAt the bottom of the tree don't you treat me like I have no feelingsDon't you treat me like that, I have feelingsDon't treat me like that
Sane, sane, they're all insane, fireman's blind, the conductor is lameA Cincinnati jacket and a sad-luck dameHanging out the window with a bottle full of rainClap hands, clap hands, clap hands, clap handsSaid roar, roar, the thunder and the roarSon of a bitch is never coming back here no moreThe moon in the window and a bird on the poleWe can always find a millionaire to shovel all the coalClap hands, clap hands, clap hands, clap hands
Uncle VernonUncle VernonIndependent as aHog on iceHe's a big shot down thereAt the slaughterhouseHe plays accordionFor Mr. WeissUncle Bittmore andUncle WilliamMade aMillion duringWorld War IIBut they're tightwadsAnd they'reCheap skatesAnd they'll never give a dime to you
Shuffling down the street with his sideways feet,Stopping now and then and he'll stop again,No doubt in his mind where he's goingHe doesn't care for his hair or his teethAnd if the truth were known he's a bit of a thief,Innocently lies, and it's showingWho'd imagine he's man's best friend.Knowing he's your friend in the end.Won't be around when you shout or swearNot very sorry, he doesn't care;God knows why we call him old faithful
(Talk) This jam is dedicated to my brother Winki who is looking down on me fromHeaven Watching my every move as usual...(Chorus)There but for the grace of god do I go do I goThere but for the grace of God do I go do I go-goI'm trying to take my time on this rhymeBut it's bustin from the seemsLike a fantasy and eagerness of dreamsI'm moving all aroundOh yes, I'm making leaps an boundsTheres so much shit to say, no time to write it down
Rattle big black bonesIn the danger zoneThere's a rumblin' groanDown belowThere's a big dark townIt's a place i've foundThere's a world going on
I got a belly full of youAnd that leavenworth stuffNow i'm gonna get outAnd i'm gonna get toughYou been lying to meHow could you crawl so lowWith some gin-soaked boyThat you don't know
I'm losing myselfTrying to competeWith everyone elseInstead of just being meDon't know where to turnI've been stuck in this routineI need to change my waysInstead of always being weakI don't wanna be afraidI wanna wake up feeling beautiful todayAnd know that I'm okay'Cause everyone's perfect in unusual ways
My baby was born in a bedWith white sheets, machines and heatTraveled home in a car to a three room nest, eats and sleepsLaminate flooring to crawl on, TVTalks, starts to walk, amongst love and securityGoes to school, learns to read and writeProbably follows a team with his friendsAnd gets to ride the trainFall in love, probably fly on a planeGet to work all week and spend what he earnsOn the high street
I lift you off the earth mundane and glumOut the solar system, way past the sunTill all the fear in your heart is gone, and so onWalking through the world with no pressureInner peace beyond measureI was leaving wherever I came inWhen a man said, stopI wanna have what you haveAnd get what you gotI got it sleeping rough on the streets in the rain
I played the fool todayAnd I just dream of vanishing into the crowdLonging for home againBut home is a feeling I buried in youI'm alright, I'm alrightIt only hurts when I breatheAnd I can't ask for things to be still againNo, I can't ask if I could walk through the world in your eyesLonging for home again
Keep your eyes downKeep your head loweredKeep to yourself dearDo not tell a soulYou know it's wrongWhat they've been sayingYou knew it all alongThat I would have to goFind a place where lightShines on my reflectionA place where I canStand up on my ownNow down on my kneesUntil then please...(Chorus)
Up and down this road I go, skippin' and dodgin' from a 44|10: 03 on a Tuesday morningIn the fall of an American dreamA man is doing what he knows is rightOn flight 93He loved his mom and he loved his dadHe loved his home and he loved his manBut on that bloody, Tuesday morningHe died an AmericanNow you cannot change thisYou can't erase this
This is the right timeThis is the right placeLiving underneath a gray cloudWhen nothing ever changesI couldn't be any less proudThe heart of this town has grown coldI'm gonna get out before I get too oldThere in a better time than now'Cause all that we ever hearIs things will be better come next yearThey never, ever get any betterAnd I don't care what you've got in storeBecause I'm not gonna wait anymoreThis is our moment in the sunThis is our time to runBecause there's nothing left for us hereThere's nothing left for us anymoreSo please don't be concernedIf we never returnBecause there's nothing left for us hereThere's nothing left for us here anymoreThere's no future for us here in this placeAnd no one ever changesThey're all living in yesterday
I said I wanna touch the earthI wanna break it in my handsI wanna grow something wild and unrulyI wanna sleep on the hard groundIn the comfort of your armsOn a pillow of bluebonnetsIn a blanket made of starsOh, it sounds good to meI said cowboy take me awayFly this girl as high as you can into the wild blueSet me free, oh I prayCloser to heaven above and closer to you
I've sure enjoyed the rainBut I'm looking forward to the sunYou have to feel the painWhen you lose the love you gave someoneI thought by now the timeWould take away these lonely tearsI hope you're doing fine all aloneBut where do I go from here?'Cause without you, I'm not okayAnd without you, I've lost my wayMy heart's stuck in second place, ooh, oohWithout you
It was about five 'til five on FridayWe were all getting ready to goAnd the boss man started screamingAnd his veins began to showHe said you and you come with me'Cause you're gonna have to stayMy heart was thumping I was jumpingI had to get awaySome days you gotta danceLive it up when you get the chance'Cause when the world doesn't make no senseAnd you're feeling just a little to tense

How many times have i felt down insideThe need to be loved by youI wanted to show you how good it could beIf you would only show a little interest in meBat you run, you just won't show loveThat's the thing you're frightened ofHe's a runnerYou came into my life and tuned my head aroundAnd just as quickly you put me downNow you don't won't to know what i'm going through'Cause just like i said, it means nothing to you
Over the Forgotten seaVoice of angel is calling for meOh oh oh oh ooSomewhere, where the mountains collideThat's where I'll find my new lifeOh oh oh oh ooI have carried this burden so long for youThat nothing but sorrow I feelI have let myself believeThat nothing would hurt deeper than the truthNever has the wind blown like thousand years agoEverything that I've known has left me on my ownNever have I felt the rain fall down like the burning flames
I woke up today in LondonAs the plane was touching downAnd all I could think about was MondayMaybe I'd be back aroundIf this keeps me away much longerI don't know what I would doYou've got to understand it's a hard life,That I'm going throughAnd when the night falls in around meAnd I don't think I'll make it throughI'll use your light to guide the way'Cause all I think about is you

Did you forget that I was even alive?Did you forget everything we ever had?Did you forget? Did you forget about me?Did you regret ever standing by my side?Did you forget what we were feeling inside?Now I'm left to forget about usBut somewhere we went wrongWe were once so strongOur love is like a songYou can't forget itSo now I guess this is where we have to stand
I was lost, on my ownAnd I couldn't bear the thought of my lifeI was gone, caught in the torturing memoriesAnd they burned like fireWater can never heal such painCan't you believeNothing is realCan't you seeI cannot feelTake me awayBury me in the sandCause after all these years I am still the sameA sad and bitter manTake me away
I have come to unfold your mindIn my veins runs the poison wildIn the streams of mountains I flowI have opened the doors for unleashed and endless hateIt will burn like the raging green flamesInside a man dwell secrets so coldThrough the dreadful storms, across the frozen oceansI have come from the dark lands with sorrow in my handsThe firewind rages in the skyAnd my luminous sword hungers for more
If I could turn the pageIn time then I'd rearrange just a day or twoBut I couldn't find a waySo I'll settle for one day to believe in youTell me liesTell me sweet little liesOh, no, no you can't disguiseAlthough I'm not making plansI hope that you understand there's a reason why
Deep into the flesh the arrows cutFrom the hope of the hunter's bowWounded we fallWith bleeding hearts we crawlTaking shelter from the arrowsCut the trembling fleshAnd don't let the tears tame youRip your arrows outAnd make them cut deeperCrush my mouth, for it still sings praises to youRun the blood out from my throatFor I'm still your's"And the hope will dieWhen the curtains fallAnd silence the pain"
Lived your life to the fullWith a lifetime of smiles.Made us know right from wrongAlways knowing of lies.You made us be toughBut never too roughRise above's what you saidNever easily lead.And one day we'll all sing alongCause this is your songWe wrote it for you.It won't take all dayJust a minute or two.You were our friendWalk with you to the end.And one day we'll all sing along
Nothing lasts foreverOf that I'm sureNow you've made an offerI'll take some moreYoung loving may beOh so meanWill I still surviveThe same old scene?In our lighter momentsPrecious fewIt's all that heavy weatherWe're going through
Some expression in your eyesOvertook me by surpriseWhere was IHow was I to know?How we can drive to a movie showWhen the music is here in my car?There's a band playing on the radioWith a rhythm of rhyming guitarsThey're playing
Yesterday, when it seemed so coolWhen I walked you home, kiss goodnightI said "it's love", you said "alright".Its funny how, I could never cryUntil tonight, when you pass byHand-in-Hand with another guyYou're dressed to kill, and guess whos dying...Dance away the heartacheDance away, tears.Dance away the heartacheDance away, fears.Dance away...Loneliness, is a crowded room
Golden waves in all directionsI could lose my soul right hereColor lights on the runwayMakes a stranger feel unchainedI'm running after time and I miss the sunshineSummer days will come happiness will be mineI'm lost in my words, I don't know where I'm goingI do my best I cannot to worry about thingsI feel loose, I feel haggard
Do I need?DestinyDo I need?Schedule liveDo I need?Working trendsDo I need?Recess linesLucky and unhappyVote for a freestyle lifeLucky and unhappyDriving on the freeway flash line
Shoot, use your gun of lifeI'm not afraid to dieIn your armsShoot, use your gun of lifeKeep on watching mePoison me目覚めさすPrince from the biomass愛欲の波に泳ぐ叶えよう

Grey skies clouding up the things we used to see with wide eyesMaybe everything was meant to be this wayWill it ever changeBut are we stuck here on our own(Chorus)It's all gone greyIt's all gone greyI found telling you the truth the hardest thing to get outI know it wasn't you that made me feel this wayWill it ever changeOr are we stuck here on our own.
I could tell you the wildest of talesMy friend the giant and traveling salesTell you all the times that I failedThe years all behind meThe stories exhaled.And I'm drying outCrying outThis isn't how I goI could tell you of a man not so tallWho said life's a circus and so we are smallTell you of a girl that I sawI froze in the moment and she changed it all

This old world aint never change the way it's beenAnd all the ways of war can't change it back againI've been a-searchin' for the dolphins in the seaAnd sometimes I wonder, do you ever think of meI'm not the one to tell this old world how to get along
You're in control, is there anywhere you want to go?You're in control, is there anything you want to know?The future's for discoveringThe space in which we're travellingFrom the top of the first pageTo the end of the last dayFrom the start in your own wayYou just wantSomebody listening to what you say
What if there was no lightNothing wrong, nothing rightWhat if there was no timeAnd no reason, or rhymeWhat if you should decideThat you don't want me there by your sideThat you don't want me there in your lifeWhat if I got it wrongAnd no poem, or songCould put right what I got wrongOr make you feel I belongAnd what if you should decideThat you don't want me there by your sideThat you don't want me there in your life
When I was a young boy, I tried to listenAnd I wanna feel like thatLittle white shadows, blink and miss themPart of a system, I amIf you ever feel like something's missingThings you'll never understandLittle white shadows sparkle and glistenPart of a system, a planAll this noise, I'm wakin' upAll this space, I'm takin' upAll this sound is breakin' upMaybe you'll get what you wantedMaybe you'll stumble upon itEverything you ever wanted
Trying hard to speak andFighting with my weak handDriven to distractionIt's all part of the planWhen something is brokenAnd you try to fix itTrying to repair itAny way you canI dive in at the deep end
How long before I get in?Before it starts, before I beginHow long before you decide?Before I know what it feels likeWhere to, where do I go?If you've never tried then you'll never knowHow long do I have to climbUp on the side of this mountain of mine?Look up, I look up at nightPlanets are moving at the speed of lightClimb up, up in the treesEvery chance that you getIs a chance you seizeHow long am I gonna standWith my head stuck under the sand?I'll start before I can stopOr before I see things the right way up
My song is loveLove to the loveless shownAnd it goes upYou don't have to be aloneYour heavy heartIs made of stoneAnd it's so hard to see clearlyYou don't have to be on your ownYou don't have to be on your ownAnd I'm not gonna take it back
You see the world in black and whiteNo colour or lightYou think you'll never get it rightBut you're wrong, you mightThe sky could fall could fall on meThe parting of the seaBut you mean more mean more to meThan any colour I can seeAll you ever wanted was loveBut you never looked hard enoughIt's never gonna give in itself upAll you ever wanted to beLiving in perfect symmetryBut nothing is as down or as up as us
You cut me down a treeAnd brought it back to meAnd that's what made me seeWhere I was going wrongYou put me on a shellAnd kept me for yourselfI can only blame myselfYou can only blame meAnd I could write a songA hundred miles longWell, that's where I belongAnd you belong with meAnd I could write it downOr spread it all aroundGet lost and then get foundOr swallowed in the seaYou put me on the lineAnd hung me out to dry
Sunlight opened up my eyesTo see for the first timeYou'll open them upAnd tonight rivers will run dryAnd not for the first timeRivers will runHundreds of years in the futureIt could be computersLooking for life on earthDon't fight for the wrong sideSay what you feel like

Married him in April, lost him in July;Listen to my story and I'll tell you why,They said that he'd been poaching and stealing wine,They said I wouldn't see him for a long long time.Chorus: They said he's gone to America,To work the land that some called Virginia;
Only this momentHolds us togetherClose to perfectionNothing else out thereNo one to guide usLost in our sensesDeep down inside I know our love will dieOnly this momentHolds us togetherLost in confusionFeelings are out thereScared of devotionDoubting intentionsDeep down inside I know our love will dieStay or forever goPlay or you'll never know
It was me on that roadBut you couldn't see meToo many lights out, but no one here near hereIt was me on that roadStill you couldn't see meAnd then flashlights and explosionsRoads end getting nearerWe cover distance but not togetherI am the storm I am the wonder
What is that vitalizing sound?Calling meIn my headRepeatedlyWhat is that visionary sight?Before my eyesSo prominentSo mesmerizing turbulentYou've got a hold on meYour ingenuitySeems to be driving meDown on my kneesThe force you generateYou reinvigorateYour body talksAnd overstates(Well) I'm already drawnClose to the divineIntoxicating images are rushing through my mindEmbodiment of sinHas kindled me withinSensations seems to multiply, they're building up insideCutting through the nightRadiating lightI've seen you move the crowdI know what you're aboutThe stories I have heardThe talk about excessI know what people sayBut surely you impressCharismatic pill
Where have all the flowers gone?Long time passingWhere have all the flowers gone?Long time agoWhere have all the flowers gone?Young girls picked them, every oneWhen will they ever learn?When will they ever learn?Where have all the young girls gone?Long time passingWhere have all the young girls gone?Long time agoWhere have all the young girls gone?Gone to young men, every one
Searching for diamonds in the sulphur mine,Leaning on props that are rotten,Hoping for anything, looking for a signThat I am not forgotten;Lost in a labyrinth of future mystery,Tracing my steps, all mistaken,Trusting to everything, praying it can beThat I am not forsaken,I wait by the door,Wondering when you will come and keep me warm.
Now my days are growing cold,All the memories unfoldThinking 'bout the friends we lost,Wondering how to count the cost,Now my days are growing coldI can hardly wait any longer,Now the feeling's growing strongerThinking 'bout the times we had,Good times always turn into bad,Now my days are growing coldWhy don't you take me for a little while,Sing me songs, you know, will make me smileWhy don't you take me for a little while
Take me to your river, baby, take me to your seaPurify my soul an' pour your ocean over me.Lead me to your chamber, where you sleep at night,Scratch your name across my back, make me feel alright.You're the best time I have ever had,You look so good, oh babe, you must be bad.Diamonds on your ankles, sapphires on your shoes,Your little gems of wisdom chase away my blues.Mama's little princess, daddy's pride and joy,
I hear the ticking of the clockI'm lying here the room's pitch darkI wonder where you are tonightNo answer on the telephoneAnd the night goes by so very slowOh I hope that it won't end thoughAloneTill now I always got by on my ownI never really cared until I met youAnd now it chills me to the bone
We may still have time, we might still get byEvery time I think about it, I want to cryWith the bombs and the devil and the kids keep comingNowhere to breathe easy, no time to be youngBut I tell myself that I was doing alrightThere's nothing left to do tonightBut go crazy on youCrazy on youLet me go crazy, crazy on you, ohhMy love is the evening breeze touching your skinThe gentle, sweet singing of leaves in the windThe whisper that calls after you in the nightAnd kisses your ear in the early moonlight
Today you looked around to my heart's callThis tiny life ain't been strangled after allTime, time, time, timeNever ask what's become of usJust dedicate your sorrowHere and nowTo the soul of the seaAnd meRushin' to meYou turned around to my song's callYou dreamer in the sandJust lie there laughing til the fallKindest loverI can't stay alone tonightBring me all your loveHere and nowCome rushin' to me

Well this stone that I have swallowedIsn't going down so wellAnd this road that I have followedIs leading me to HellAnd you said it didn't matterBut I think you're a liarIs this one of your talentsThat stokes the very fire that burns youEach time you try to liveAnd the earth will turn below youThe pressure is buildingAnd something has to giveOh something has to giveAnd when I build you a steepleYou say it's incomplete'Cause you need the whole cathedral

In the privacy of our loveThere is nothing outside our loveIn the privacy of our loveWe're in each other as hand in gloveIn the privacy of our loveThere is nothing outside, above
"Don't wake meI'm still dreamingI don't see youI can't feel youI'm alone for real in my mindI'll feel this all nightWhen my life takes flightThis isn't just in your mindWe're suspended from space and timeI feel like I'm fallingWhat happens when I hit?Must mean then that's itThis black abyss, this pitIt all seems shades of gray
Hello, goodbye, I wanted to see, but I guess II don't have the strength to speak tonightIt's tricky sometimesWhen you wanted to run, you'd always hideYou can't find the truth behind the liesAnother day and I'm on my feetBut the street feels like it's sleepingI'm on a mission and it ain't too sweetYeah, you're the reason, I'm afraidSaid, you're the reason, I'm afraidBut I want you to know, it's killing meI think I gotta let go 'cause it's killing meYou're gonna do what you wantBut you better believe, it's killing meLove never diesIt's the reason that I won't compromise
There was a time when I would have followed youTo the end of the earthI was willing to share it all with youThe love, the hurtI've seen you when your dreams were falling in the dustBut I never stopped believing in youI always thought our love was strong enoughOne you could hold on toChorus:You never see it comingYou just let it flyOn silent wings, silent wings
When I was a little girl I had a rag dollThe only doll I¡¯ve ever ownedNow I love you just the way I loved that rag dollBut only now my love has grownAnd it gets stronger in every wayAnd it gets deeper let me sayAnd it gets higher day by dayDo I love you my oh myRiver deep, mountain high
Higher than reason.The shrine is locatedIn the front room of the house.For some unknown reasonIt's been neglected for too long.You claim it's not a problem,But i take it all so hard.So when is it a problemIf you push it all so far?Higher than reasonHigher than reasonIs nowhere.Higher than reasonHigher than reasonIs nowhere.
Ooh, girl, it's what you say between a phraseIt's written in your faceIt's rain against the windowpaneThe sounds it makesIt's dreamin' the day awayIt's the shine of a precious pearlLight of the worldThe smile of our baby girlIt's finding a moment for a thought so pureIt's a walk along the shoreI hold on to the feelings'Cause I dont know when I will feel it againI've become amused by the little things
She sleeps with the moonlight under her headAnd the stars to keep her warmFar from the noise and the world belowShe comes to me in my dreams like a love songAnd I awake only to hear her goSomewhere along the way I lost the melodyAnd I don't want the birds to sing, sing it to me'Cause I love to hate the feelingDon't wanna deal with the morning afterWhat can I say to keep it down?What can I say to keep it down?What can I say to keep your love around me?She walks with me on frozen stone, ever so lightly
You look at me from every angle, follow my every moveFrom the bed to the doorAnd what you see could mean a million things, too early to assumeI'm the one you've been waitin' forHold my handSomething you don't have to understandFor you to doHold my handC'mon lover, get under my skinIt'll all make sense to youDay and night, you watch me from your hiding place and won't tellAnyone else about usFootsteps in the shadows reveal secrets of a young male
Send up a smile for me, babyI say to the rising flameA dynamic woe blows in with the coldAnd brings back the loneliness againYour voice, it haunts my natureWith the words that I used to make you bleedWith one hand and my imaginationI thought I'd never need for anythingBut my spaceship crashed against the wallMy neighbour's grass ain't so green after allI wouldn't have a second thought about the fallBut I'm wondering who will love me in winter
He's a blind man, crouching by the pavement,Only seeing with his third eyeAnd clutching at the astral shadowOf every passer-by.He's a wise man, trumping all the answers;She's a wild girl, trying to keep his feet on the floorIn whispered physical litanies:
Left the earth in 1983,Fingers groping for the galaxies,Reddened eyes stared up into the void,1000 stars to be exploitedSomebody help me I'm falling, somebody help me, I'm fallingDownInto sky, into earth, into sky, into earth ...It is so dark around, no life, no hope, no soundNo chance of seeing home again ...The universe is on fire, exploding without flame.We are the lost ones; we are the pioneers;We are the lost onesWe are the ones they are going to build a statue forTen centuries ago or were going to fifteen forward ...
Existence is a stage on which we passA sleepwalk trick for mind and heartIt's hopeless, I know, but onward I must goAnd try to make a startAt seeing something more than day to daySurvival, chased by final deathIf I believed this the sum of the life to which we've comeI wouldn't waste my breathSomehow, there must be moreThere was a time when more was felt than knownBut now, entrenched inside my settIn light more mundane, thought rattles round my brainWe live, we die... and yet?In the beginning there was order and destinyBut now that path has reached the border and on our kneesIs no way to face the future, whatever it beThough the forces which hold us in placeLast through eons in unruffled graceWe too wear the face of creationAs anti-matter sucks and pulses periodicallyThe bud unfolds, the bloom is dead - All space is living historyIt seems as though time must betray us, yet we're aliveAnd though I see no God to save us, yet we surviveThrough the centuries of progressWhich don't get us very farAll illusion! All is bogusWe don't yet know what we are
North was somewhere years ago and coldIce locked the people's hearts and made them oldSouth was birth to pleasant lands, but dryI walked the waters' depths and played my mindEast was dawn, coming alive in the golden sunThe winds came gently, several heads became oneIn the summertime, though august people sneeredWe were at peace, and we cheeredWe walked along, sometimes hand in handBetween the thin lines marking sea and sandSmiling very peacefullyWe began to notice that we could be free
Then when you let itYou asked for nothingWhy don't you share it?All of the time you liveThere's something out thereThis one will know, how far to live onThis one will ever know in this town
Drivin' outta Vegas in their automobileShe was in the back seat while he was at the wheelWith the windows wide openAll the money from the store, they'd gambled awayHe said "the best laid plans often go astray"She took the page of a book and turned it downShe lit a cigarette, she didn't make a sound"And I know, if we'd had just one more chance," he said"I know, we'd finally hit the big one at last", she said
The sun don't set in GettysvilleThe place that I call home,A thousand people walk these streetsBut we're still all alone,This city's isolationLike the drug that paves the roads.Take the subway uptownTo my mother's place.She's got a thousand friendsBut all they know of her's, her face,All alone inside her headHer thoughts begin to race.Live it upLive it up they sayLive it upNo time to waste your life away.Next door to me the ceiling leaksCracks stretch across the walls,Like skeletons of dreams deceased
I wanna loveI wanna leave.I want you to love meI want you to leave me.I want to stand where I can seeI'm watching you love meAnd I'm watching you leave me now.I wish i could beSomebody else.I wish i could seeYou and myself.I wish there was something inside meTo keep you beside me.And sayWhat you really feel.You know i needSomething that's real.I wish there was something inside meTo keep you beside me.
You're making choice to live like thisIn all of the noiseI am silenceWe already know how it ends tonightYou run in the dark through a firefightAnd I would explode just to save your lifeYeah I would explodeLet me light up the skyLight it up for youLet me tell you whyI would die for youLet me light up the skyI can't find a wall to pin this toThey're all coming down since I've found youI just wanna be where you are tonightI run in the dark looking for some lightAnd how will we know if we just don't tryWe won't ever knowLet me light up the sky
I'm backBack in townAnd everything has changedI feelFeel let downThe faces stay the sameI seeSee shadowsOf who we used to beWhen I driveDrive so slow through this memoryWhen we were only kidsAnd we were best of friendsAnd we hopped for the bestAnd let go of the rest
(Dear Bobbie, do you rememberWhen you were young and very pretty? I doI remember pleated skirts, black and white saddle shoesDo you remember dancing that night? I doI still think of you when we danceAlthough we can't jitterbug as we did then)Do you remember whenHow long has it been?Nineteen forty fiveYou opened my blue eyesTo see a whole new lifeDo you remember whenI told you this that nightThat if you're by my sideWhen everyday beginsI'll fall for you againI made a promise whenI told you this that nightThat I'll be fineCause when I die then I'll die loving you
It won't be long nowThe music's on loudWe'll sing this song outAnd then we'll lie downI'll hold you close thenAnd let you know whenThe space and time bendAnd then we'll fall inGo put on your best tonightIt's you and me and one spotlightOne more show one last timeWe are readySay you will be all around meWhen your body sets your heart freeSay you will be all around me
Let's burn a hole, so we can climb outOf these paper walls, and this empty house.Don't listen too close, their words are like guns.With bullets that fly and kill what you've won.Let's burn a hole, so we can climb outOf these paper walls, and this empty house.We're the only thing that's real.These visions we have of ten years ago,Of stars in the sky and us down below.In streets and east coast lines,We kept this scene alive.Here I am, still hold on to this,
I could feel at the timeThere was no way of knowingFallen leaves in the nightWho can say where they're blowing?As free as the windHopefully learningWhy the sea on the tideHas no way of turningMore than thisYou know there's nothingMore than this
It's so nice to meet an old friend and pass the time of dayAnd talk about the home town a million miles awayIs the ice still in the river, are the old folks still the sameAnd by the way, did she mention my nameDid she mention my name just in passingAnd when the morning came, do you remember if she dropped a name or twoIs the home team still on fire, do they still win all the games
Monday morning came too soon.I think about you nowLayin' in my room.Hearing everything you said.I play it backA hundred time in my head.Then I slip into a dream.The feelin' insideIs ten stories high.Never knew what love wasUntil you loved meNever knew what love wasOh yeah.'Cause it feels so good sometimesAnd it feels so bad sometimes
I can't ignore or hide awayYou can't escape from the things that line our wayTake it, leave it, break itAnyway you can't get back to yesterdayAll I want, all I want to doIs make you listen from now onStop what's going on, stop what's going wrongYou better listen from now onConfidence, coincidence,Call it a sin, it's just like people say
Night time slows, raindrops splash rainbowsPerhaps someone you know, could sparkle and shineAs daydreams slide to color from shadowPicture the moonglow, that dazzles my eyesAnd I love youJust lying smiling in the darkShooting stars around your heartDreams come bouncing in your headPure and simple everytimeNow you're crying in your sleepI wish you'd never learnt to weepDon't sell the dreams you should be keepingPure and simple everytimeDreams of sights, of sleigh rides in seasonsWhere feelings not reasons, can make you decideAs leaves pour down, splash autumn on gardensAs colder nights harden, their moonlit delightsAnd I love youJust lying smiling in the dark

I've heard magic through the doorHalf stairs upI stopped: too fastMaybe the key will turnFour white walls and only one echoI guess I talk to myself againWith tens of voicesSchizoframedSoul for me a littleBefore the soul is goneShake a little
This song was meant to hurtWas meant to beAbout the broken worldIn a broken girlThese wordsI found written on my windowBy the L the lipstick deadI thought I've seen her cryingI thought she ran too fastI thought I'd make her stopBut I just stood there,Watched her fightIf I could live it one more timeReverse the daysBack to where I begun

It's five o'clock this morningAnd the sun is on the riseThere's frosting on the window paneAnd sorrow in your eyesThe stars are fading quietlyThe night is nearly goneYou slowly turn away from meAnd tears begin to comeAnd it's goodbye againI'm sorry to be leaving youGoodbye again'Cause if you didn't knowIt's goodbye againAnd I wish you could tell meWhy do we always fight when I have to go?It seems a shame to leave you nowThe days are soft and warm

They'll be hiding in the shadowsThey'll be hiding in the dark of the nightThey'll be hiding 'til tomorrowThey'll be hiding 'til the timing is rightIt's an answer for the futureIt's a question that we left in the pastIt's a message for the massesIt's a problem but it ain't gonna lastOoh, you will give to meTomorrow, tomorrowTomorrow, tomorrow, today
You said, it's six weeks since she left youAnd you looked at me with tears in your eyes"But I think of her with all my respect", you said"I'm always gonna love her, I never will forget herShe's always gonna be a part of me"When April snow is fallingAnd you wish you were somewhere elseWhen you wake up in the darkest part of the nightWhen April snow is falling down
Remembering everythingAbout my world and when you came,Wondering, the change you'd bringMeans nothing else would be the same.Did you know what you were doing, did you know?Did you know how you would move me? Well,I don't really think so.But the night came down and swept us away.And the stars, they seemed, to paint the most elaborate scene to date.How could we know, that song, this show,
Are you getting tired?I think we've gone, and lost the fire.But I don't wanna fight anymore,I've had enough, of this town.I can see the signs,And I can read between the lines.But I don't know what we were fighting for,I'm just trying, to breakout.I've been waiting for something,I've been sitting for too long.I've been waiting but oh tonight,This one last try, goes on and on and on[2x]You put your nets out,And still you chose to do without.The only way to catch a butterfly,
Am I alone in this?Never a night where I could sleep myself 'til day.We must try (to) figure it out, figure it out.It won't be that easy; we lost it somehow.You come over unannounced,Silence broken by your voice in the dark.I need you here tonight just like the ocean needs the waves.Oh, the night becomes the space that's somewhere in betweenWhat I feel and what I'm told.Sitting on the shoreline trying to figure it out, figure it out,To find out the meaning and reach it somehow.
Wasted time...I cannot say that I was ready for this, butWhen worlds collide,And all that I have is all that I want,The words seem to flow and the thoughts, they keep running,And all that I have is yours;All that I am is yours.
Left BankLeft bank, I'm waiting for someoneSomeone to be my friendOutside, traffic's running slowlyI hear it from my windowWithout you, I'm getting lostWithout you, there's no release
There's a place off Ocean AvenueWhere I used to sit and talk with youWe were both 16 and it felt so rightSleeping all day staying up all (Night)Staying up all (Night)There's a place on the corner of Cherry StreetWe would walk on the beach in our bare feetWe were both 18 and it felt so rightSleeping all day staying up all (Night)Staying up all (Night)If I could find you now things would get better
Called me out, you stayed insideOne you love is where you hideShot me down as I flew by, crash and burnI think sometimes you forget where the heart isAnswer no to these questionsLet her go, learn a lessonIt's not me, you're not listeningNow can't you see something's missing?You forget where the heart isTake you away from that empty apartment
What's a dad for, dadTell me why i'm here dadWhisper in my earThat i'm growing upTo be a better man, dadEverything is fine, dadNow that you are mine dadCause i know that i'm growing upTo be a better manFather i will always beThat same boy that stood by the seaAnd watched you tower over meNow i'm olderI want to be the same as youWhat's a dad for, dadTell me how to stand, dadTook me by the hand dad
Broken this fragile thing nowAnd I can't, I can't pick up the piecesAnd I've thrown my words all aroundBut I can't, I can't give you a reasonI feel so broken up (so broken up)And I give up (I give up)I just want to tell you so you knowHere I go, scream my lungs out and try to get to youYou are my only oneI let go, there's just no oneThat gets me like you doYou are my only, my only one
If I could I would do all of this againTravel back in time with you to where this all beganWe could hide inside ourselves and leave the world behindAnd make believe there's something left to findWe'll be miles apartI'll keep you deep insideYou're always in my heartA new life to startI may be leaving but you're always in my heartNow we've all grown up, gone on and moved awayNothing I can do about it, nothing I can sayTo bring us back to where we were when life was not this hard (life was not this hard)Looking back it all just seems so far, so far away
I got to tell you that he waited all his lifeFor someone like you to come make the wrong things rightI know he didn't have the answers all the timeBut you can't tell me that you've never told a lieWe're almost twenty-three and you're still mad at meSo much that I said to you and I want to take it back nowTwenty-three and it's so sad to meYou tell the world I'm dead to youBut I know you want me back. Now
I'm just so tiredWon't you sing me to sleepFly through my dreamsSo I can hitch a rideWith you tonightAnd get away from this placeHave a new name and faceI just ain't the same without you in my lifeLate night drivesAll alone in my carI can't help but startSinging linesFrom all our favorite songsAnd there are melodies in the airSinging Life just ain't fairBut sometimes I still just can'tBelieve you're gone
Think about the love inside the strength of heartThink about the heroes savin' life in the darkClimbin' higher through the fire, time was runnin' outNever knowin' you weren't going to be comin' down aliveBut you still came back for meYou were strong and you've believedEverything is gonna be alrightEverything is gonna be alrightEverything is gonna be alrightBe strong, believeBe strong, believeThink about the chance I never had to sayThank you for giving up your life that dayNever fearing, only hearing voices callin' outLet it all go, the life that you know, just to bring it down aliveAnd you still came back for meYou were strong and you've believedEverything is gonna be alrightEverything is gonna be alrightEverything is gonna be alright
Don't knowWhat I was looking for when I went homeI found me aloneSometimesI need someone to say, you'll be alrightWhat's on your mind?But the waters shallow hereAnd I am full of fearAnd empty handed after two long yearsAnother sunny day in CaliforniaI'm sure back home they'd love to see itBut they don't know that what you love is ripped awayBefore you get a chance to feel it
You've stolen my heart and I want you to rememberNow what'll I do? living aloneYou've stolen my heart and it hurts me to rememberNow where'll I go to? living aloneAnd a butterfly in the wind is drifting like I do
She's all weak and her heart beats soShe can't speak with the lights so lowJust to be one of a crowdFeet scuttling across the floorSpinning lights round and roundIt's adolescent war
Over the rooftops a plane in the skyBeat of a bass drum cars passing me byUnder a bridge dark then back into lightA river of raincoats and a forest of facesStill for a moment then red into greenSlow shuffling shoes whisper sight unseenRow upon row of houses return an empty stareLet the daydream for a little while longerAh. yeah...Hope I'll never wakeWhen I'm thinking about you
Gone forever, the writing on the wallThey've boarded-up the cinemaStrawberry dreams and the dust-filled beamsShut down in a modern townSee you walking, see you talkingRecollection on streets you used to knowForgotten pleasure smoulderImages fade but the town won't let them go
Oh, look at the sun, it's all aglowSlow burning star, sinking lowHeaven knows where you goOut of sight, out of minds eye, noOh, such a shame, you must leaveAll day long you were a friend to meStill the moon's company
There you go baby, and here am I,Well you left me here so I could sit and cry.Golly gee, what have you done to me?Well I guess it doesn't matter anymore.Do you remember baby, last September,How you held me tight, each and every night?Oh baby, how you drove me crazy,But I guess it doesn't matter anymore.There is no use in me a-crying,I've done everything now, I'm sick of trying,
Well, I walked over the bridgeInto the city where I liveAnd I saw my old landlordWell, we both said, "Hello"There were nowhere else to go'Cause his rent I couldn't affordWell, relationships changeOh, I think it's kinda strangeHow money makes a man growOh, some people they claimIf you get enough fameYou live over the rainbowOver the rainbowBut the people on the streetOut on buses or on feetWe all got the same blood flow
Go ahead baby,Run away again.Growing tired of chasing you.I know you only have time,To love me.You've got nothing better to do.Who's bold enough to believe?Even love or war.Both just leave you busted,And broken down.Wanting more.
I am at ease in the arms of a womanAlthough now most of my days I spend aloneThousand miles from the place I was bornWhen she wakes me, she takes me back homeNow, most days I spend like a childWho's afraid of ghosts in the nightI know there ain't nothing out thereI'm still afraid to turn on the lights
Did you believe itWhen they told you they discovered you?And that everything is freeAs long as you do what they tell you toYou think it's true?But nothing could be farther from the truthMy loveDid you even listenWhen I told you to change your name?Now, no body wants honesty

I'm coming from a long line of painMy family suffered greatly for my gainAnd I think a lot aboutHow my daddy diedSo I would not live with itAnd his heart lives in my songAnd the melody comesAnd just as quickly the melody is goneI'm back alone, far from homeNow my mamma's all alone
I keep on livin',To keep from cryin'.I keep on dreamin',To keep from dyin'.I keep on trying,I aint gonna stop.Get right down to the bottom of the barrel and float back on top.We all know someone,Whos always hurtin',
I went to see my grandma todayI learned the difference betweenLiving and aliveWall to wall roaches in a two by four infested roomLying there in painPraying for the Lord to take herNora - I hope it won't be too long for youNora - All these years you've been so strongNora - I hope you don't mind if I call you NoraI love you
You spend half the time dreaming, the other half's a lieYou don't know where you're going and you don't know how to tryYou don't really have a best friend but you think that you're in loveNow all you can remember are the words he used the mostLike the "lie" in believeThe "I" in decieveThe "her" in togetherThe "we" in the weatherHe said a lot of things I'm sure he meant them at the timeBut it's not the end of the world
Cross my heart and hope to dieIf I should ever let myselfBe used againAs an instrument of my destructionIt's like tearing apartIt's breaking my heartFor you to see this side of meThe things I try to my best to keep insidePromises may get brokenBut there's one thing that I knowI promiseI will hold you closer and closerI will hold you in these arms of mineI will hold you, hold you, hold youCloser, closerOver and over again
You are here and warmBut I could look away and you'd be gone'Cause we live in a timeWhen meaning falls in splinters from our livesAnd that's why I've traveled far'Cause I come so together where you areYes, and all of the things that I said that I wantedCome rushing by in my head when I'm with youFourteen joys and a will to be merryAll of the things that they say are verySentimental gentle windBlowing through my life againSentimental lady, gentle one (all I need is you)Sentimental gentle windBlowing through my life again
Feeling only left him bleedingFor a whole number of reasonsHe never discoveredBut soon he would be riding his waveCoast to coastAll his life was rosy and pinkFluffy in the middle a constant grinAnyone would think soBut see that body shakingSee that body racingFeel that body baking from insideThe boy's a satelliteHe won't be home tonightAnd we crown ourselves againThere's been no change since you and I were young
There's far too many ghostsIt makes us rely on three notesThat could make you weepSad notes that blister in your heartI hopeAnd don't I knowDon't I realize what's changing in our brainsAnd how it soothesCos its better than the truthThe truth is frayed at the edge and bruisedNo use anymore

We went down to the old part of townBy the stinking canal and the cotton millUnder a ghetto palm with her bicycle shorts onWith a gesture she said to meI really must confessI'd like to get undressed with you

She came out westTo find the sunShe lost her nameBut found a new oneAmy goes to school all dayBut at night in the neighborhoodThey call her AmphetamineShe is perfect in that fucked up wayThat all the magazinesSeem to want to glorify these daysShe looks like a teenage anthemShe looks like she used to be happy withThe girl insideShe looks so bored sometimesShe has that super pale skinAnd those soft green eyesShe looks like she could have been happyIn a better lifeShe came out westJust to break away cleanFrom her family and friends
I heard the truth about youAnd it doesn't really read at allLike the whipping stick you raised me withA scared woman in a private hellHushed voice like electric bellsStrange talk about Edgar CaseyAnd the long lame walk of the dark 70'sStrange talk about Edgar CaseyAnd the long lame walk of the dark 70'sI heard the truth about youYeah youMama, they woke me upI was deep in an idiot sleepI was just 8 years oldHeard big words with horrible soundWhy'd they have to call my schoolTell me my mother had a nervous breakdownI wish i believed like you doYeah youIn the myth of a merciful godIn the myth of a heaven and hellI hear the voice
I'm on the phone I can't say anything in case I say the wrong thing,And you smile like you like this but maybe it's not working,I'm a stone under a mountain and I wish that you'd stop thinking,And you lie under the mountain cause you know you can't do anything.And you check your phone 'cause you're looking for an escape,Sometimes when we fall we just land in the right place,'Cause we're magnetic and we land in the right place,Are you magnetic do you land in the right place?It tasted bad I wore a mouth guard the blood was overwhelming,Head over heel a mild concussion do you remember was I talking,You've been had and in attack you said maybe we're exhausting,It's not real but in attack I know just what you're saying.
I slipped away last nightTook me away from sight and the place I know.All crushed upon my skinThis mess I put you in and the punch I thrown.It was a strange reactionFor someone like you to remain on sideAnd in a chain reaction
Once there were green fieldsKissed by the sunOnce there were valleysWhere rivers used to runOnce there were blue skiesWith white clouds high aboveOnce they were part ofAn everlasting loveWe were the loversWho strolled through green fields
I slipped away last nightTook me away from sight and the place I knowAll crushed upon my skinThis mess I put you in and the punch I thrownIt was a strange reactionFor someone like you to remain on side

The first star I see may not be a starWe can't do a thing but waitSo let's wait for one moreAnd the time's such clumsy timeIn deciding if it's timeI'm careful but not sure how it goesYou can lose yourself in your courage
Take advantage of these times, you saidYou let me downIt hasn't been the first timeAs I'm falling in the pit of fire my mind's made upI'm never coming back hereAnd how long would it take meTo walk across the United States all aloneThe West coast has been traumatizedAnd I think I'm the only one still aliveIs it just a coincidence to see youBy yourself with no directionNow it's time to move on andDon't you know that things aren't getting better
Is tomorrow just a day like all the restHow could you know just what you did?Like all the rest, how could you know just what you did?So full of faith yet full of doubt I askAgain, I shall ask you this once againHe said, "I am but one small instrument"

Over the sea and far awayShe's waiting like an icebergWaiting to changeBut she's cold insideShe wants to be like the waterAll the muscles tighten in her faceBuries her soul in one embraceThey're one and the sameJust like waterThen the fire fades awayAnd most of everydayIs full of tired excusesBut it's too hard to sayI wish it were simpleBut we give up easily
If I was looking for youWould you be easy to findWould I be looking all night?And if I got lostWould you go looking for me?Or would you be all rightOn your own?Oh, in the light of dayIt feels rightComfortable to the boneFrom head to toeCome the evening when the shadows fallWell I call your nameBut it's not the same as having you here
Love will abide, take things in strideSounds like good advice but there's no one at my sideAnd time washes clean love's wounds unseenThat's what someone told me but I don't know what it means.'Cause I've done everything I know to try and make you mineAnd I think I'm gonna love you for a long long timeCaught in my fears
Here come the nightingales,Or could it be the mockingbird,They're at my windowsill,They flew in as soon as they heard.Enter the doctor and the nurse,Say my condition's getting worse,They take my pulse and shake theirHeads,They recommend I stay in bed.They say you are my condition,You are indecision,You,What is wrong with you?You say you love me but you don't love me,You say you hate me but you don't hate me,You say you'd leave me but you can't leave me,Because you love me,What's it gonna be,What is wrong with you,
The weatherman says, "Goodnight"The Empire State Building's turning off it's lightsThe refrigerator stops and suddenly it's quietI never noticed the ceilings were so lowI never saw all the cracks on the windowI never saw myself as sentimental but here I goWithout you I've been standing 'round you like a statueLaying on the floor, thinking about youI talk to myself like the crazies doOtherwise I'm great, what about you?
I never should have left you,While you were sleeping,You never would have heard a word I said,We were both screaming,So I guess I'll be the coward,Who never woke you up,But I prefer you blame me,Then blame it all on your love.And on the radio,It's a sad song that I don't wanna hear anymore,It goes Julia,Don't turn around,Don't go back now,The bridges are down the bridges are down,Julia,All the doors are locked,All the roads are blocked,
Seconds, hours, so many daysYou know what you want, but how long can you waitEvery moment lasts forever when you feel you've lost your wayWhat if my chances are already goneStarted believing that I could be wrongBut you give me one good reasonTo fight and never walk awaySo here I am — still holding on!With every step you climb another mountainEvery breath it's harder to believeYou'll make it through the painWeather the hurricanesTo get to that one thingJust when you think the road is going nowhereJust when you've almost gave up on your dreamsThen take it by the hand and show you that you canThere are no boundaries

The higher that the monkey can climbThe more he shows his tailCall no man happy 'till he diesThere's no milk at the bottom of the pailGod builds a churchThe devil builds a chapelLike the thistles that are growing'Round the trunk of a treeAll the good in the worldYou can put inside a thimbleAnd still have room for you and meIf there's one thing you can say

The conflict has been fierce from the start.Too many people, a lot of brain, a lot of heart.Building the foundation of violence to be.Bloodstain on the VCR, radio and the TV.Acting like we didn't see this coming.Ignoring all the bombingsAnd the war with the kingWho's pulling the strings.He's on top of the food chain,But without the wings.Without the wings.Without the wings.I can't (live with this)Need to take a stand(We need to resist.)
There is a storm in my heart that tears my inside apart.It's not so smart standing in a corner when it's time for us to,Start up this engine that took us this far,Not reaching for the stars, you know how we are,And we will keep it that way, just make the feeling stay,And when we're down, we must say that this can brighten up our day.This is the sunlight that brightens up my day.Stepping up on stage when everything feels dull and gray.And we can't keep this inside, how we're feeling this time.You're half of it so we cannot quit,Keep building it up with brick after brick.

I've been asked to write a song without a swear word or a slightAt myself or another, for my mother for my brideA song that'll shine on my kids and theirs to comeSomething that'll love them and watch over when I'm goneTo my ward, to my wheel-chair, to my runner's-up dripWill you push me will you pull when I'm too fat to see myDidn't I always tell you I'd stay for 2000 years?You'd better hope that science fiction doesn't have good earsYou're rubbing on my genie hurry up and make a wishQuenched that thirst my bag is burst watch out for all myFlies trying to break in to my eyes like little rymes
We're on the way back in the moment nowWe're on the way back in the moment nowI stare into space, I'm in your mind nowI did grieve you, you somehowI stare into you, will you bear more pain?I know your thoughts drive me insaneI close my eyes alone in my roomThere is no silence in my headI try to see the truth, the way I loose

Sleep until the end of timeAnd rest as you were mineThey say you're lacking speedRun, before our heaven breaksEventually she wakesTo burst into a thousand tearsOh, I can't feel you, 'cause I am full of glueThe vault behind this jealous glance is bluePounce on me
Can you hear me stumbling, My Friends?? Cause suddenly the darkness became my friend, that strokes my headCan you hear me counting the days?? Cause every little second that passes by just hurts like hellLeaving is my only choiceWill you cry for me?? Cause all of the men that looked in your eyesAnd all of the boys that lie at your feet

Groovin' on a Sunday afternoonReally couldn't get away too soonI can't imagine anything that's betterThe world is ours whenever we're togetherThere ain't a place I'd like to be instead ofMovin' down a crowded avenueDoing anything we like to do
I'm a tourist,World at my feet.Across hither and ditherAnd hither and ditherAnd hither and ditherWont fall off my seat.I've a camera,Keep my photos in a book.The more i keep shooting and shootingAnd shooting and shooting and shootingAnd shooting,The less i have to look.
There was a boy who ran awayFrom what he didn't knowAnd whom he wouldn't say he just had to goSomething it snapped inside of him as he fled from a nameless threatCrowds of people stand aloof in Waterloo there's no sunsetAnd when he gets to that mythic place the streets are
If you don't trust me i'll fallI've wind in my sailsBut the seas make me paleAnd the floorboards are creaking belowFind me the oarsTo row me to shoresWhere the natives will say helloEmotion pulls you like a horse drawn cartYou can but only follow it into the day into the darkWhere are the fruitsGrowing from promised roots?How far can this beer be thrown?Here, take from meThis supposed ability

Looking back now I regret,You're a promise that I never kept.Waiting in my room in vain,Time winds back and back again.Outside the school gates,We first met in a basement near the park(Diamonds in the dark)We danced all night and then we kissed,Your smile like diamonds in the dark.It's a long way to fallWhen the words strayNo-one callsWe would have little children,We would be together forever.(Diamonds in the dark)We would live on the Delancy Street,Then you cut your hairAnd it ended there.
When I was ten years oldI remember thinking how cool it would beWhen we were goin' on an eight hour driveIf I could just watch TVAnd I'd-a given anythingTo have my own Pac-Man game at homeI used to have to get a ride down to the arcadeAnd now I've got it on my phoneHey, glory, glory, hallelujahWelcome to the futureMy grandpa was in World War IIHe fought against the Japanese
I remember trying not to stare the night that I first met youYou had me mesmerizedAnd three weeks later, in the front porch lightTaking 45 minutes to kiss goodnightI hadn't told you yet, but I thought I loved you thenAnd now you're my whole life, now you're my whole worldI just can't believe the way I feel about you, girlLike a river meets the sea, stronger than it's ever beenWe've come so far since that dayAnd I thought I loved you then
How the heart bends,And summer, she sendsA sky that refuses to die.With the weeds of the seaThat wrap 'round our knees,And a sun too hot to go down.You come around,You come around,You come around,You come around,You come around,

Your friends hold the lullabiesThey watch the way the night liesSoft sounds, heads like a radioHearts wrapped in blankets laying lowHearts wrapped in blankets laying lowYou're cold, maybe you just missed the sunYou fall, feeling like it's just begunSo far, keeping it together's been enoughLook up, rain is falling, looks like loveYour boy is like a memory

I freeze my hands as I close the doorTo wait in line so I can wait some moreAnd it's true what they say about loveYes it's true what they say about lifeAnd I'm taking it for all it's worthI watch the numbers register on the postal scaleI think of your hands and calculateHow a man, desired, feels the weight of a letter
Flushed chestI saw you tonightThrough the dim twilightIt was deep deep summerWith that yellow moonAnd you were sleepingI saw you tonightYou were in your ghostSinging white ChristmasHow you knowIt's before meIt's your songSo divineDying timeIs a partOf your laughterI saw you todaySelling all your clothesYou were done with HollywoodThe waterfall was rushingThrough you

I miss it so muchNo button to touchNo dial to turnNo key to holdDays turn to nights turn to weeksTurn to paper into rocks into plasticMy material heartHow it keeps us apartWatching days turn to nights turn to weeksTurn everything I got into techniquesMy mechanical heartHow it tears me apart
When I walk up to your doorWhen I walk into your roomAnd open windowsCan you hold it in your handCan you make me understandThe tension, the pressureAnd I know just what it meansTo be left out all aloneI got it just like thatGo, go, go, go, go, go, go, goI wanna go, go, go, go right back again
Movies like zoosTry another me and I willTry another youOr put my arms around youLike I think you want me toBut tell me what you're thinkingI so often misconstrueTreading waterTreading white wineSeeing borders seeing straight linesI get these feelings that I don't have much timeAlways rushing always late (x2)Movies like zoos
Nothing was supposed to hurt like thisMissing you was always one more kissNow there's nothing that I can doOne more nail in the coffin, and it's all for...You always were and always were a simple love storyYou're were everything I ever hoped and dreamedDrown me in a pool of my bloodIt's getting harder just to breatheI'll suffocate you faster just so you can't seeSo you can't see me sleepIt's getting harder just to say the right thingsI've seen the angel's faceAnd I've heard her sing to meFrom my reflection on this razor bladeI've heard ten thousand dying screamsAnd they're calling meDay will break on this saddest day
It's fucking freezing outside because I saw you tonight and almost diedLooks like I've seen too many winters in my mindYour stare is cold, you better turn and run awayBecause you're the evil, we will keep on hunting youKillingSo what more do you want from me?We will carry the weight you can't carryTalk your shit about usWe don't give a fuck anywayYou'll be the one to cryYou'll be the one to fade
Just a papercut to spill your bloodJust a papercut to spill your bloodI hear screams come out the windowMaybe next time your caress won't feel like rusted nailsI am the son of rejectionSo hold me to the lightTell me it's right to feel dead insideI won't break, not todayI won't break, not todayDead like meDead like meBecause beneath this stare is a desperate fight to stay aliveTell me I'm not alone
We were born to be aliveWe were born to be aliveBorn, born to be alive(Born to be alive)You see, you were bornBorn, born(Born to be alive)People ask me whyI never find a place to stopAnd settle down, down, downBut I never wanted all those thingsPeople need to justifyTheir lives, lives, livesYou see, you were bornBorn, born to be alive(Born to be alive)You see, you were born

The nights are so lonely and the days pass me byTrue love has faded, left me behindSo we'll just move along and stop wasting timeIt's over, all over nowIt's over, end of the lineIt's over and you're doing fine
You may walk away in angerWear your heart upon your sleeveYou make act like it don't matterKeep me laughing while you leaveBut burning bridges won't get me backIf you change your mind some dayWhy can't we turn this scene aroundBefore you walk away?Will you be leaving, leaving me today?Like the ocean leaves us waiting on the sand
You've made up your mind, we don't want the same thingAnd that we can't change thingsWishin' there were waysAnd there's no use staying togetherNothing lasts forever,that's what you sayAnd that makes one of us not in love
1, 2, 1, 2How does it feel like thisTo be caught in a web of a heavy gripWhere you might won't believe or try to admitThat the one that you love is a fool you don't realize?When will you finally wake up?And the love that you hold is a taste of bad luckAnd all that you have is a bag full of liesHe's blinded you deep by the look in the pit of his eyesAnd if I knew that this could be a total catastropheI probably would have told you a little sooner so you wouldn't get hurtIf I could change this possibly it would be how you want this to be'Cause it ain't over till it's all doneSo let me finish my conversationAnd yes, I'm tryna get your attention'Cause you're distracted by affectionCan't you see that it isn't true?Love you thought you had and you knewAnd I've been chosen to tell youThat you're stupid and you know you gotta do it, leaveWhen you are deep in love

Too many Florence NightingalesNot enough Robin HoodsToo many halos not enough heroesComing up with the goodsSo you thought you'd like to change the worldDecided to stage a jumble saleFor the poor, for the poorIt's a waste of time if you know what they mean
Something's going on, a change is taking placeChildren smiling in the street have gone without a traceThis street used to be full, it used to make me smileAnd now it seems that everyone is walking single fileAnd many bow their heads in shameThat used to hold them highAnd those that used to say helloSimply pass you byThink for a minute, Stop for a minute
Whoa oh oh owHow can I find the way to tell you thisBut things you seem to do all over meRead the dictionaryUnderstand the meaning: I want you to myself exclusivelyKinda funny how the love has come and goneNot trying to look grownTo all the fellas trying to lookI'm sorry that I took available outSeven on the car seatSix by the back streetFive on the concrete (How many bottles on the wall)Four by the windowThree in the shadowTwo only butYou're my one only bottle on the wallI tell no lie you made me fall blind to all the other guys within my life

Don't you think it's funny how we're different but yet we're all the same?Running from our similarities as if we're on a speeding trainMaybe you are thinking you're an alien coming from outer spaceBut don't you get it twisted 'cause we're all a part of human raceEverybody needs love in their lifeHow it hits us all the sameEverybody needs boy and needs girlHow we need it everydayEverybody needs you and needs meWe're not differently the sameEverybody say yes if you doEverybody shout out if it's trueEverybody needs thatWhy are we always fussing over silly little things why do we care?Can't we see the beauty in the difference and appreciate it there?So afraid of meeting different people, trying things we never knewBut maybe if we took a look and listened good we'd all know what to doEverybody needs love in their life
You're a man with thousand faces,Every day another mask.You creep within dark places,Implementing a dreadful task.You act like a man of mission,But to whom do you believe?Don't you talk to me about Jesus,Cause every word is blasphemy.Absorbed in your own mind,
My God have mercy upon me in this Hour of DeathI pray for thee to take my life instead of the one I so dearly loveHer face is pale like the ivory of the distant realmsAnd as I hold her hand in mine, I clearly feel it's turning coldLike marble or snow
The city of sin is lying in the evening glowSon of God coming through the gates,Only one will knowA man named Lot gives him shelter from the crowd outsideThey used to rape everyone passing by and do it with prideUnder the Sun this city was ill,There was nothing to tell
Walking through this wasteland,Carrying wicked thoughts within my mindWondering what will be,Is there any future for mankind?War is raging somewhereEvery second someone will dieEvil spirits in towersMagnifying holes in the sky
Please take a long hard look through your textbook'Cause I'm historyWhen I strap my helmet on, I'll be long gone'Cause I've been dying to leaveYeah, I'll ride the range and hide all my loose changeIn my bedroom'Cause riding a dirt bike down a turnpikeAlways takes its toll on meI've had just about enough of, quote"Diamonds in the rough"Because my backbone is paper thinGet me out of this cavern or I'll cave in
If you're the birdWhenever we pretend it's summerThen I'm the wormI know the part, it's such a bummerBut fair is fairIf my segments get separatedI'll screamAnd you'll be thereClose your eyes (close my eyes)Slide the cotton off of your shoulderAnd feel the shine (feel the shine)I'm hooked so toss me overAnd cast the line (well, I'll try)I'll throw a party and greet my undersea friends (it depends)As they arrive (if they arrive)You and I left our troubles far behind (troubles far behind)But I still have just one more question on my mindFor all my pals who live in the oceans and the seas
Hello Seattle, I am a mountaineerIn the hills and highlandsI fall asleep in hospital parking lotsAnd awake in your mouthHello Seattle, I am a manta rayDeep beneath the blue wavesI'll crawl the sandy bottom of Puget SoundAnd construct a summer homeHello Seattle, I am the crescent moonShining down on your faceI will disguise myself as a sleeping pillAnd descend inside of you
Stems and gears, oh, how the daisies bloomWhen chandeliers light up the engine roomCan you feel the drops as it starts to rain?There's an underwater Ferris wheelWhere I found the missing link to this island chainHome will always be hereUnseen, out of sightWhere I disappear and hide
Welcome backWinter once againAnd put on your warm fuzzy sweater'Cause you'll feel much better whenThe snowflakes fallGently to the groundThe temperature dropsAnd your shivers freeze all the rivers aroundBut I keep you warmIf speed's a proInertia must be a con'Cause the cold wind blows at precise ratesWhen I've got my ice skates onIf all the roads
The stars lean down to kiss youAnd I lie awake and miss youPour me a heavy dose of atmosphere'Cause I'll doze off safe and soundlyBut I'll miss your arms around meI'd send a postcard to you, dear'Cause I wish you were hereI'll watch the night turn light blueBut it's not the same without youBecause it takes two to whisper quietlyThe silence isn't so bad'Til I look at my hands and feel sad
Keep your clever linesHold your easy rhymesSilence everythingSilence always winsIt's a perfect alibiThere's no need to analyzeIt will be all rightThrough the longest nightJust silence everythingBut we could live by the foot of the mountainWe could clear us a yard in the backBuild a home by the foot of the mountain
This road is anything but simpleTwisted like a riddleI've seen high and I've seen lowSo loud, the voices of all my doubtsTelling me to give upTo pack up and leave townBut even so I had to believeImpossible means nothing to meSo can you lift me upAnd turn the ashes into flamesCause I have overcomeMore than words will ever sayAnd I've been given hopeThat there's a light on up the hallAnd that a day will come when the fight is wonAnd I think that day has just begun
Do you remember the last time I saidIf I ever thought of lyingI'd rather think of dying insteadAnd the last time you called meTo say we were throughHow it took a million tearsJust to prove they all were for youBut it wouldn't have made any difference,If you loved meHow could you love meWhen it wouldn't have made any difference,If you loved me
(Michael McDonald - Michael Johnson)Are you leaving, are you going?Did you think you could lose that feeling without me knowingAre you wishing you'd never met meDoes it take some train whistle blowin' to forget me.
Who would sell their soul for love?Or waste one tear on compromiseShould be easy enoughTo know a heartache in disguiseBut the heart rules the mindAnd the going gets roughPride takes the fallWhen you find that kind of loveI can't help feeling like a foolSince I lost that place insideWhere my heart knew its way
I hope that I won't be that wrong anymoreI hope that I've learned this timeI hope that I find what I'm reaching forThe way that it is in my mindSomeday I'll get over youI'll live to see it all throughBut I'll always missDreaming my dreams with you
Don't change your nameKeep it the sameFor fear I may lose you againI know you won'tIt's just that I am unorganizedAnd I want to find youWhen something good happensIf you come downWe'll go to townI haven't been there for years
We do believe it ends right hereThe orchestrations and the dream is clearShuttle departs and they're all thereEveryone's cracking up but we don't careAnd we agree it's what we need, orchestra realWhisper the cymbals ride on in
Wanna cry for youWould it do any good?If I rained for youIt would just be waterAnd the night's with youAnd the storm's in your handAnd you're down, and you're downAnd I can't lift youI'm powerless to change your worldI'm powerless to stop the hurtBut I'll give you my heartGive you my shoulderI give you my heartGive you my shoulderOver and overWanna run for you
I have slept beside the winterAnd the green is growing slowI have watched you find the placesHidden by the snowI have tripped into a valleyThat is blue 'til you can seeI want you to comeWalk this world with meWith the light in our eyes it's hard to seeHolding on and on 'til we believeWith the light in our eyes it's hard to seeI'm not touched but I'm aching to beI want you to come walk this world with meAnd I'm sucked in by the wonderAnd I'm fucked up by the liesAnd I dig a hole to climb in
Fall for me, my southern cross, my starShine for me when love has gone to farI've got you belly deep in meJust a little breath on the water is all we needJust a little strength in our heartsEnough to healEnough to healDig me out, can't leave this love for deadHand to mouth we're picking up the thread
There are parts of me he'll never know,My wild horses and my river beds,And in my throat voices he'll never hear.He pulls at me like a cherry tree,And I can still move, but I don't speak about it.Pretend I'm crazy, pretend I'm dead.He's to scared to hit me now, he'll bring flowers instead.I need an island, somewhere to sink a stoneI need an island, somewhere to bury you,Somewhere to go.
On the Vermont Transit Bus I leaned my arm into a little chink of sun,Going somewhere older than I was,Strapped into something tight, keeping me small.I dug into you like rock climbing;Too scared of coming down,Too scared of going up,Too scared of rockface.I should've split my sides or spilled my guts or hit you or something,But I was good, and your father's little pancakesSo round and perfect and me sitting up too straight,Laughing in wrong places, kissing you,Kissing up, kissing too soon.
My heart it sits inside meIt don't know we said good byeYou see it's having trouble feeling goodThe way it did, the way it shouldI know it knows that something's wrongIt hears me play these awful songs
Put out the word, we need a new tasterThere's one King left and so much food to eatThe interception by the last one was absolute professionalismIf he's laying there saying he's sorryTell him it's okay, we learn this wayTaster you're the automatic SaintRival sabotaged a bad pot of duck stewWith just one breath left, he warned the dinner crew
On the telephone all morningIt's been awhile since i talked to youYour voice, it transferred sweetI wish forever, i could talk to youOf course i blame that guy tomI'm sure he talked you into doing itAlthough i'm sorry he is dead
Wishful thinking I might be yoursDrifting on every stepI'm always drawn to the dark horseSweet sweet, oh nothing's saidAnd every dream is just a dream, after allAnd everything stands so still when you danceEverything spins so fastAnd the night's in a paper cupWhen you want it to last
I've got a memory a thousand years oldAnd I know secrets I've never been toldAnd I've got jewels I haven't foundAnd they'll return me to the ground(Chorus)I'm the girl, I'm the girl, I'm the girlYou know meI'm the girl, I'm the girl, I'm the girlAnd I'm a siren; I'll wreck you on my shoresAnd I'm Godiva; I'll call you back for moreAnd I'm Medusa; and I'm your favorite doll
I'm rolling down a well worn roadI'm wondering if I'll ever knowIf I'll be better than I was beforeWhen I surface through the service doorByeI'm on standbyOut of order or sort of unalignedPowered down for redesignBye bye
The talk, it got so loudThe songs cut outWell, that's when I'd had enoughOf all their talk and stuffI had to bring it downTo more level groundWhere my only companyIs wind blowing through the leavesMy head they tried to wreckAnd I just laughed and saidGuess who lost the go in the go-for-it
Trouble with a capital T"Tie him down" they saidBut tired ain't for meLet this one flyI wonder what they'll make of meWhen i'm good and gone in songIn God's countryLet this one flyOff on a merry wayOften in a lotta daysLost on yer merry wayCause unrevealed and never knownAnd never known
Doo doo dooSo there's my babyLaughing at me in the sunWonder if I'm the weaker oneI feel so far away from homeAlways so far awayThe Pacific will pacify us when we're doneIf only we weren't always spunI feel so far away from homeAlways so far awayFrom El Caminos in the westAll collapsed and futureless
She's in the kitchenCryin' by the ovenIt seems she really loved himAn' he's so drunkHe's passed out in a DatsunThat's parked out in the hot sunIn the saddest vacant lot in all the worldWorldWorldWorldBoldly goin'Where he rarely knows
I woke up Tuesday morningTo coming downWithout a soundComing back downThe pressure put upon meIt goes and goesTil it thinks it got meIt tries and triesAs it might to trick meInto breaking back downI'm OK
In a dreamYou were sitting there waiting by the door for meAnd I got the opportunityTo experience the experience once againHow it could have maybe beenBut in real lifeYou're in another worldYou're with another guyWho doesn't have to cheatAnd never has to lieAnd all that stuff I didn't getComes so easy to him
I never know their names, But i smile just the sameNew faces... Strange places, Most everything i see, Becomes a blur to meAnd i'm wasted because, The fast pace is too muchHere at the final push to the sumIf my old life is done, Then, what have i become? What have i become?
À cinq heures cinquante-cinqAwake with open eyesA drift upon the nightAnd miles away from land5:555:55À cinq heures cinquante-cinqAnte meridiemToo late to end it nowToo early to start again5:555:55Soon the morning will arriveCan I begin another day
In the playgroundChildren sing their songs and skin their kneesPlay, little monsters, playI remember doing just the same so many years agoAnd the things they'd sayI could handle sticks and stonesBut those words still break my bonesChorusLittle monsters that rule the worldYou don't know what you're really sayingStop before someone ends up getting hurt
I feel you all around meYou are everything i cannot seeAs the ocean crawls onto the shorelineSo you lap at the edges of meAnd now, as i'm walkingI know that you're watching me moveFor as much as i need youI must walk away from youYou're my life, you're my hopeYou're the chain, you're the ropeYou're my god, you're my hellYou're the sky, you're myselfYou're the reason i'm livingYou're all that i have to discoverYou're the rain, you're the starsYou're so near, you're so farYou're my friend, you're my foeYou're the miles left to goYou are everything i ever wantedAnd you are my loverSo i carry i carry the flowersThe flowers that are dead in my handsThey will rise up at the very sight of youThey will naturally understandThat today is the dayThat we find out once and for allNow you know i must leave here
Last night i saw a ghostHe seemed familiar to meI welcomed himWith open armsHe said my nameAnd laid me downAwoke the dreams still sleeping in my bones
[Altus/White]There's got to be a solutionThere must be a cureSomething to get me through this confusionWhat will it take to set me free?The time that's passed is full of frustrationSo much to tell, but no words to sayI've suffered enough and my dues are paidNo turning back nowI'm on my wayWhen I look back I seeA time of misery
[Altus/Piercy/White]Rip the pages from the book of liesNever will we ever fall to compromiseNow we're back to set the record straightFueled by anger, our pain has turned to hateSymptoms of stagnation are coming to an endSolitude's frustration has been our only friendNow we must break free.

My friends feel it's their appointed dutyThey keep trying to tell me all you want to do is use meBut my answer yeah to all that use me stuffIs I wanna spread the news that if it feels this good getting usedOh you just keep on using me until you use me upUntil you use me upMy brother sit me right down and he talked to me
I think that possiblyMaybe I'm falling for youYes, there's a chance that I've fallen quite hard over youI've seen the paths that your eyes wander downI want to come tooI think that possiblyMaybe I'm falling for youNo one understands me quite like you doThrough all of the shadowy corners of meI never knew just what it was about this old coffee shop I love so much
Nervous and your tearing at the seamsThe lights are too bright and you've got cold feetYou look the part and you're only seventeenCan you drag me up and show me what we're missing out onDon't waste your timeWe've heard it all beforeWe've had enough and hangers on and "friends" we didn't wantDon't waste you're timeWe've heard it all before
If it hurts this muchThen it must be loveAnd it's a lotteryI can't wait to draw your nameOh, I'm trying to get to youBut time isn't on my sideIf the truth's the worst I could doThen I guess that I have liedKeeping me awakeIt's been like this now for daysMy heart is out at seaMy head all over the placeI'm losing sense of timeAnd everything tastes the sameI'll be home in a dayI fear that's a month too lateThat night I sleptOn your side of the bed, soIt was ready when you got homeWe're like noughts and crosses in that
& I'm standing on a platformNow I'm staring from a train& All the trees roll back beside but I'm so obliviousTo the dark to the lightIt's all the sameYou gave me so much& Now it's of the earth& It makes me cry
Shock, got the shock of my lifeJust buckle up, girls, I'm stealing the nightFrom them steal the nightWhat they're down to, let's see in cold day lightI got to get this rightI got to get this right'Cause she's up and I am lowWatching you watching her play this gameYeah, she's bold, bold enoughTo set fire to your plainHer fire to your plain
Cigarettes recommended"Need a light to use?"Said the lady in blueAfter the rainWhat is left? What is right?"You may understandI left the right man"Said the lady in blue"I left the right man"Boys play well into midnight"Can I join you?"Said the lady in blueAfter the rain
The strength of her pulse is breaking her chestShe's getting wet from this feverish writhe.The midnight's cruel for a lonely girl.When the unknown slowly undresses her breastsThe voice - and her eyes wide shutHer fever burns a mark on her bedThe path that she runs among these silent treesLeads her body for me to claimThe veil of fog covers her velvet skin
Now I'm a gray old ghostWeeping in winter treesAnd searching for a soulWaiting for a voice to comeShe was worth dying forIt is my severed woes, I cryHer eyes were pale like dawnOut of this gloomy light
One night it happened, the morning never cameIt has been snowing ever sinceThe plague of cold harvests the landAnd only few still wait for the sunCities are buried under a white curseRemains of the man lay on the glacial groundThe monuments of ice curve upon usLeading our way to the bitter endOne night it happened, the morning never cameThe clocks tick anew this same hour of dark
Out from the north into the southWinter turned his frozen mouthTearing down the voices of livingLeaving bodies buried in iceThe wrath of distant cloudsAnd the weeping of the ground, it will comeCold wind carries the voice of doomSinging songs for the damnedDescending winters for all landsAll hope is gone in his hands
Wash your handsAnd light the candlesTurn the lights outAnd I'll turn the music onI'll serve you food you've never tasted beforeAnd after the midnight hourI'll treat you like a real man shouldThis is a portrait of a clear mindThe profile of my kindI'll bring flames on your face
Sinking in the depths of her warm caressBut the dagger I hide won't shed forgivenessHer secret is revealed or am I wrongThough her flesh is weak, my hand is strongThere slow days and endless nightsI have learned her waysThese open wounds and bleeding scarsLed me to her burning trails
I remember herDark flowing hairEyes like deep blue watersAnd her skin so fairI remember herHow she used to singMelodies so full of sorrowDreams in the makingShe was so fragileLying on my arms, not breathingI can still hear the echo of her voice
The fountain runs quietThrough the emerald steps and lavender airThe statues praise the beauty of hersFlowers bloom around her marble breastsSilver drops of the open night skyLight this ruined gardenThe vines hanging on pillars and walls
The velvet fog came after the sun wept her last raysShedding her tears for the night,The night she'll never seeThe all-seeing eye, the dead light of lunaWatched as the gloom gently closed the flowersBut the ones I laid upon herStayed open to mourn my lossThe night air never hurt so deepAs it whispered praises of despairTo keep in this lonely heart
It came with the nightfallThe dark that swallowed the starsOne by one it painted them blackAnd brought horror to our heartsIt came down in the shape of rainA wall of black watersSpreading the end to the earth belowAnd I ran and left them allAway from those dying voices
N-no, n-no, it can't be trueN-no, n-no, it isn't youN-no, n-no, it's not the way you areN-no, n-no, it isn't youN-no, n-no, it can't be trueN-no, n-no, it's not the way you areBad dreams for meBad dreams by the sea
Don't Want To KnowI don't want to know 'bout evil, I only want to know about loveI don't want to know 'bout evil, I only want to know about loveSometimes it gets so hard to listen

Now maybeI didn't mean to treat you badBut I did it anywayAnd then maybeSome would say your life was sadBut you lived it anywayAnd so maybeYour friends they stand around they watch you crumbleAs you falter down to the groundAnd then somedayYour friends they stand beside as you were flyingOh, you were flying oh so highBut then someday people look at you for what they call their ownThey watch you sufferYeah, they hear you calling homeAnd then some day we could take our timeTo brush the leaves aside so you can reach usYeah, but you left me far behindNow maybeI didn't mean to treat you oh so bad

It's that ole devil called love againGets behind me and keeps giving meThat shove againPutting rain in my eyesTears in my dreamsAnd rocks in my heartIt's that sly old sun of a gun againHe keeps telling me that I'm the lucky one againBut I still have that rain
Oh, it's a long time since I saw youWell you know how time can flyIt seems like yesterday we were loversNow we pass each other byBut if we're left alone tonight, don't ask me to hold you tightI go weakI go weakI go weakI go weak, weak in the presence of beautyAll my friends, keep askingWhy I'm quiet while you're around?
Silence is empty, filled with breaths from mouthsThat never move no moreShe talked some more, she talks nowAnd all the lights went out in empty roomsAnd now the empty hallI talk alone, i talk nowAnd all I wanted was a Chance to see you anyway
Game over,It's a new ownerPunches chipping off your prideMove slower,You're one day older,Find the darkest side of the nightSneak a pictureAbove my shoulderDon't make a sudden moveYou'll spoil the lightOh noOnce, double strideRoll again till it's rightTwice, sudden startMove around, find the partPan forward,And frame the border
Thank you once againI can barely get through itI can't draw a lineWithout it falling off the pageAnd i can't hold a faceWithout it moving from the frame'Cause there's a tremor in my lipsAnd an itching in my eyesIt's all 'cause of youSo take the covers offThey been keeping off the dustSteady down the arms
I don't like youBut I love youSeems that I'm alwaysThinking of youOh, oh, oh,You treat me badlyI love you madlyYou've really got a hold on me(You really got a hold on me)You really got a hold on me(You really got a hold on me)Baby, I don't want youBut I need youDon't want to kiss youBut I need toOh, oh, ohYou do me wrong now
Paralyzed by ancient delightAnd riding for a fall todayI am dressed in style, so eager in mindBut furthermore distracted by youAnd it's like I lose myselfIn dreaming of summer days in bloomOh, I've got no clue how I could fight thatAll that I am is worth a dimeWorth a dime
Girl, you remind me of summertimeBut now you need time to clear your mindYou're tripping over what is wrong and rightJust decide, I've been waiting all nightThink back, think back, to the summertimeI would cross through these state linesYou were always on my mindIt should not be this hard to seeHow to get from point A to BWithout losing sleep, without losing sleepI will follow the electric linesWith my electric heart I then will findA way through all these damn street signs
I want to tellIf I am or am not myselfIt's hard to knowHow far or if it all could goWaited far too longFor something I forgot was wrongI don't know all the answers, I think that I'll findOr have it within the timeBut it's all that I'll have in mindUntil I fall away (until I fall away)I won't keep you waiting longUntil I fall away (until I fall away)I don't know what to do anymoreUntil I fall away (until I fall away)
It's a beautiful world we live inA sweet romantic placeBeautiful people everywhereThe way they show they careMakes me want to sayIt's a beautiful worldIt's a beautiful worldIt's a beautiful worldFor you, for you, for youIt's a wonderful time to be hereIt's nice to be aliveWonderful people everywhereThe way they comb their hairMakes me want to sayIt's a wonderful place
She sings some song while you can't seeShe sits in the top of the greenest treeShe sends out an aroma of undefined loveIt drips on down in a mist from aboveShe's just the girl, she's just the girlThe girl you wantShe's just the girl, she's just the girlThe girl you wantYou hear her calling everywhere you turnYou know you're headed for the pleasure burnBut the words get stuck on the tip of your tongueShe's the real thing but you knew it all alongShe's just the girl, she's just the girlThe girl you want
Late last night when the squire came home,Enquiering for his ladySome denied and some repliedShe's gone with Black Jack DavyGo saddle to me the bony brown steedFor the grey was never so speedyI'll ride all day and I'll ride all nightTill I catch that Black Jack DavyHe rode up hills and he rode down dalesOver many a wild high mountainAnd they did say that saw him goBlack Jack Davey he is hunting
As I walked down through Chatham StreetA fair maid I did meet.She asked me to see her home,She lived in Bleeker Street.Chorus (after each verse):And away you Santi,My dear honey,Oh you New York girls,Can't you dance the polka?And when we got to Bleeker Street,We stopped at forty four.Her mother and her sister thereTo meet her at the door.
Running in the parking lot, I'm four years oldI am lost, those were the daysSoft murmur of voices in the other roomComforting you, as you fall asleepStaring at the mother-daughter clones go byWe're in a race against timeAnd time might be winningAnd it's not gonna take all day longWatching the urban decay all around us, oh boyAnd I'm on my way, oh, somewhereFeels like I'm going left and right in the darkHow long must you waitHow long must this stayWake up I'm ashamed that there may have be sometimes
I hear it in your silenceWhen you don't speak...Well what's funny thenIsn't funny anymore.I can hear it in your voiceThere's always a catchWe're going nowhereAnd we're going there fast.Anything to watchWhile we are waiting for this ApocalypseWhat more is there to do?It's nice to be important, but so close to being despisedIt's more important to be nice, I guess, than being wise
I wish air clouds could hold me upLike I thought as a child, growing upI wish I could soundSoothing as the rainfallBut I am only, a drop from the stormFeel like a tourist out in the countryOnce this whole world was all countrysideFeel like a tourist in the big citySoon I will simply evaporateThe streams up northThe drums down south
Mind made up, i'd given all for youC'est la folie d'amourBy now my mind is clearYou planted all the fearDoubts and despair andYou keep my heart on the runI'm bound to fall in love with the oneQui ne m'aime pas
We are what we're supposed to beIllusions are your fantasyAll dots and lines that speak and sayWhat we do is what you wish to doWe are the color symphonyWe do the things you wanna seeFrame by frame, to the extremeOur friends are so unreasonableThey do the unpredictableAll dots and lines that speak and sayWhat we do is what you wish to doIt's all an orchestra of stringsDoin' unbelievable thingsFrame by frame, to the extremeOne by one, we're makin' it funWe are the Cartoon Heroes, oh-oh-ohWe are the ones who're gonna last foreverWe came out of a crazy mind, oh-oh-ohAnd walked out on a piece of paper
I see you, girl, walking over hereCan't look awayI see you left a trail of broken heartsOn your way to meI try to not let it showBut I know that you know, yeahYou break me down every time you make a moveWithout a sound, girl, you make me come ungluedAnd I don't know what you did to meAnd I don't care what the doctors say'Cause no matter what you doI can't stay away from you, oh, ohI can't stay away from you, oh, oh
I always played you songsTo say what I never couldOther people say it betterSay it better than I wouldBut for every word left unsaidI thought you understoodIt was easier to kiss youThan to tell you how I feelOh and I don't want to lose youBut you can't see that through your tearsYou're saying that I hurt youBut I had no idea...(I'm doing my best to make itBut you don't believeBelieve that I am)Just cause you say it's soDoesn't make it soSinging I don't showWhat I'm feeling for youI'd rather shut my mouthThan to spell it outThere's no doubt
Unspoken, in silenceLet's stay here tonightThere's no reason to ask meCause you know what's insideDon't worry nowSeasons will changeForgive my mouthFor not letting you walk awayTake your love, bring it backBring it backThink before you leaveI forgot what love isBring it back

I wake up, put my poker face onIt's roughly the same hand I was dealt yesterdayI stand up and stare out at the skylineIt's roughly the same town that I saw yesterdayLiving doesn't come first tryIt takes a lifetime getting it rightIt takes a lifetime to learn how to singTo find my place in the world symphonyTo become the melodyThe man I know I could beIt takes a lifetimeIt takes a lifetime
Life's been blinding meFrom what I thought I'd seeIs there clarity in this insanity? (yeah)What's she want from me? (yeah)Roads in front of meTaking me astrayAre you leaving me?Or are you leading the way?Can you hear what I'm saying?

Had a dream that we were dead, but we pretended that we still lived.With no regrets we never bled and we took everything life could giveAnd came up broken empty handed in the endIn the hearts of the blind, something you'll never find is a vision of lightWith the voice of the dead, I'm screamingI don't know who I am anymoreNot once in life have I been real but I never felt this close beforeI've been looking in your window I've been dressing in your clothesI've been walking dead, watching you, long enough to know I can't go on.
Just howHow many timesHow many times have I sat right here and seen that skyline at twilightAnd told myself I'm gonna be alrightBut at the last light after saying goodbyeYou can't rest at night inside your headYeah at that last light after sayin'goodbyeIt's such a sad sight cause of what we said(Ahh, oh)

There's some things I forgetAnd if it's wrong, I keep it in check'Cause what could I doIf we go out tonightWith that blood on your shirt?Would it taste like a brand new shirt?'Cause I don't know

It's her first night on the town since she was just eighteenA lady down on love and out of hope and dreamsThe ties that once bound her now are broke awayAnd she's like a baby, just learning how to play.She never thought that love could ever end so soonHer mind drifts back in time to a mid-summer moonWhen he asked her to marry and she gladly said okayAnd a woman came to be from the girl of yesterday.
Everybody see's it's youI'm the one that lost the viewEverybody says we're throughI hope you haven't said it tooSo whereDo we go from here?With all this fear in our eyesAnd whereCan love take us now?We've been so far downWe can still touch the skyIf we crawlTill we can walk againThen we'll runUntil we're strong enough to jumpThen we'll flyUntil there is no endSo let's crawl, crawl, crawlBack to love, YeahBack to love, Yeah
In December drinking horchataI'd look psychotic in a balaclavaWinter's cold is too much to handlePincher crabs that pinch at your sandals(Whoaaaaa ooooh)In December drinking horchataLook down your glasses at that AranciataWith lips and teeth to ask how my day wentBoots and fists to pound on the pavementHere comes a feeling you thought you'd forgottenChairs to sit and sidewalks to walk on(Whoaaaaaa ooooh)
An ancient business, a modern piece of glassworkDown on the corner that you walk each day in passingThe elderly sales clerk won't eye us with suspicionThe whole, immortal corporation's given its permissionA little stairway, a little piece of carpetA pair of mirrors that are facing one anotherOut in both directions, a thousand little JuliasThat come together in the middle of Manhattan
Holiday, O, A Holiday!And the best one of the yearDozing off underneath my sheetsWhile I cover both my earsBut if I wait for a holidayCould it stop my fear?To go away on a summer's dayNever seemed so clearHoliday, still so far away
Your sword's grown old and rustyBurnt beneath the rising sunIt's locked up like a trophyForgetting all the things it's doneAnd though it's been a long timeYou're right back where you started fromI see it in your eyesThat now you're giving up the gunWhen I was 17I had wrists like steelAnd I felt completeAnd now my body fadesBehind a brass charadeAnd I'm obsoleteBut if the chance remainedTo see those better daysI'd cut the cannons downMy ears are blown to bitsFrom all the rifle hitsBut still I crave that soundYour sword's grown old and rustyBurnt beneath the rising sunIt's locked up like a trophy
I had a feeling onceThat you and ICould tell each other everythingFor two monthsBut even with an oathWith truth on our sideWhen you turn away from meIt's not rightI think you're a contraI think you're a contraI think you're a contraI think you're a contraMy revolution thoughtsYour little arrows of desire
A round of applauseYou got what you wantTake a good look at what you give upBecause I'm telling youA heart can't be unbroken oh, oh, oh, ohAnd can you remember how I kiss youRecall the sweet taste in your mouth'Cause baby the memory is all you get nowAnd I'm movin, movin, movin onAll that you wantI hope you get all that you wantI hope you get all that you want'Cause I doI hope you get all that you want
Spring is here! Why doesn't my heart go dancing?Spring is here! Why isn't the waltz entrancing?No desire, no ambition leads meMaybe it's because nobody needs meSpring is here! Why doesn't the breeze delight me?Stars appear, why doesn't the night invite me?
There's too much sky and not enough blueThere's too many questions to why I love youThere's too many clouds and not enough sunThe rain must fall on everyoneI'm fire and you're the oceanI'm energy and you're the rhythmLove is somewhere in betweenWhat you believe and what you dreamI'm just trying to make you mine, you're the oceanThere's too much doubt and not enough dareThere's too much decision everywhereThere's too much talk and not enough timeLet's close our eyes and not our minds
There was a party last night, last nightCigarettes and empty bottles, empty bottlesBetter open up this window, this windowNeed some air to clear my head, clear my headAlone in these strange bedsI think that I've travelled enoughPoetry and aeroplanesI am tired of waiting for love
Can you say good-bye, without ever leavin'?That's some sad soul to keepAmanda awakes in a moment believin'She's better off stayin' asleepSo she drives by the stationImaginin' somewhere, sings a slow, slow, songNow, she's waitin' at the stoplightsWith no where to goBut in our town there's just one stoplightOh, I wish she would knowThere's a world outside her windowAnywhere the wind blowsAnywhere's Amanda's dream

It's five miles till I see my loverI guess you could say that she's more than thatI've been sat in this seat now for hoursReading my book like a mapYeah these windows are cryingAnd this train is dyingTo meet youThis train is filled with emotionsThey all make me think about youWhen we pass these old desert stationsI want to go there with you
Oh I've been haunted by this old ghost beforeI want to hear your voice you know it's been so longWell I could dance and wave you balance on the shoreOh it would feel so good to see your face againI still sleep with the lights onI still stay up late aloneI still love another oneI still sleep with the lights onOh we both understand we got no way backOh our love was strange in a strange landAnd we got broken wings we were bound to fallUntil the sun comes up you can hold my hand
I've been wishing on a star but I could never have imaginedI would land just where you are after all this lonesome travellingI took one look in your eye, reached out to hold your handThis is when I realized what I could never understandDo you want to be my one and only love?Do you want to be my one and only love?
It's been about a month and 20 daysAnd we're going round and round just playing silly gamesNow you're saying, slow it down, not right nowThen ya wink at me and walk awayLet it be, let it be, let it be knownHold on, don't goTouching and teasing me, telling me noBut this time I need to feel you(Ride it) we're all alone(Ride it) just lose control(Ride it, ride it) touch my soul(Ride it ride) let me feel you(Ride it) turn the lights down low(Ride it) from head to toe(Ride it, ride it) touch my soul(Ride it, ride) let me feel youMovida was the club on the Saturday
Love is lovelier the second time aroundJust as wonderful with both feet on the groundIt's that second time you hear your love song sungMakes you think perhaps that love, like youth, is wasted on the young
-I-I-I'mWicked and I'm lazyOoooh,Don't you wanna save meI'm lazy when I'm lovin',I'm lazy when I playI'm lazy with my girlfriendA thousand times a dayI'm lazy when I'm speaking,I'm lazy when I walkI'm lazy when I'm dancin' andI'm lazy when I talkI open up my mouth,It comes rushin' outNothin', doin' nadda, never,How you like me now?Wouldn't it be mad,Wouldn't it be fineLazy, lucky lady, dancin',Lovin' all the timeI-I-I-I'mWicked and I'm lazyOoooh,Don't you wanna save meSome folks they got money an'Some folks lives are sweetSome folks make decisions an'
There's got to be some reasonFor all this miseryA secret evil corporationSomewhere overseasThey're pulling strings,Arranging thingsIt's a conspiracyOr what about the ones whoShape the course of history?What if we petitioned for oneGrand apology?I'll write to my prime ministerYou, write your presidentEverybody's wondering howThe world could get this wayIf God is good, and how it could
I'm not alone, I really believeYou never go, You never leaveHere and now, You always stayAnd "I love you" could not be said a better wayChorusIt's everything You've promisedThere's no greater love than thisFrom prophets until todayA man laying down His life for His friendsYour sacrifice has spoken, You gave everything
What is the measure of a life well-livedIf all I can offer seems too small to giveThis is a song for the weaker, the poorerAnd so-called failuresLittle is much when God's in itAnd no one can fathom the plans He holds
Clusters of people talking secretly to each otherIn a bar you cannot talk openlyTo anyone you don't already know4-year-olds, they've got the right ideaThey jump the line and hit it on the noseWhen we sit and we get quietThen we look and see who's home across the wayThere are 80 windows we can seeIt's Christmastime and they all have the same tree
I wanna know, do you have the balls to ask?What do you see when you look at a girl?Is she a game you wanna win?If no-one was looking what would you do to get in?Do you have friends who would be proud if you went in for the kill?Do you have friends who would do it even against her will?What if they did that to your sister?What if they did that to your mother?What if they did that to your sister?What if they did that to your mom?Why are we so slow?
My friend once told me something so rightHe said to be careful of thieves in the nightBaby, I've lost you here in the crowdOpen your arms, I want to be foundMaybe I'm calling your name in the nightOpen our eyes, we'll feel with our sightA want is a lack but also desireA need can be nothing but should be held higherA need is a want wearing disguiseIt can be confused if fueled by desire
She said, how did we get ourselves so lost?And I said, I don't knowBut we will not be leaving, tonight, tonightWhen you hold me, I, I feel betterI only want one night together in our armsThis is the longest night, we're meeting arms to armsNothing is wasted and life is worth livingHeaven is nowhere, just look to the starsThere is a day that is yours for embracingEverything's nothing and nothing is oursNothing is wasted and life is worth living (I only want one night)Heaven is nowhere, just look to the starsThere is a day that is yours for embracing (This is the longest night)Everything's nothing and nothing is ours, oh, oh
Tell me where you've been toNowhere that you shouldn't doTell me what you're good forI can tell you something tooWhere have you been staying?Tell me what you're playingHope it's not my consciousBut it keeps complainingDidn't meet you in an alleyThe cats they weren't complainingI met you in the daylightOur vision's misbehavingI offer you my temperWith the hope that you would tame meWe built ourselves a shelterYou will always be my babyFeeling, keep on feeling, keep on feeling
What is the answer?Oh, you know we'd all like to knowWhat is your reason?Oh, I know we'd all long to knowThough there is nothing else left in our heartsWhat was your question?Though I know we'd all love to hearWhat were you thinking?I know that I'm with the people of the earthThough there is nothing else left in our heartsNow that we're olderThere's more that we must doWith songs we remember
Two people are alley catsWe have an unhappy catHe is restless, needs attentionLoses patience, seeks affectionMonkey grooms, blossom bloomsDo you dig germs? The germsWell, we wear each other's heads like hatsSpeak in tongues like alley catsCradle them in both our lapsWhen we lie aloneWear each other's heads like hatsSpeak in tongues like alley catsCradle them in both our lapsAnd we die aloneWell, we sleep inside a blankety bedPlanted like the crocusesIn the song my mother saidShe wanted us to singWe sleep inside a blankety bed
When the wind dies down and the howling stopsThe hurting starts, then I hear your nameIn this quiet time, this aching timeI can hear your fingers on the window paneIf I was in the dark, if I was in the lightIf we were walking through the forests of the night togetherIf we were taken down, down into the heartOf the blackest night where we could sleep forever
I just can't help believingWhen she smiles up soft and gentleWith a trace of misty morningAnd a promise of tomorrow in her eyesAnd I just can't help believingWhen she's lying close beside meAnd my heart beats with the rhythm of her sighThis time the girl is gonna stay

If i was left to my own devicesI wouldn't go out in the rainIf i was in a room with all of my vicesYou'd never see me againYou sing 'cause you're loosingThe last threads of nightThere's no time for dancing

Signal got lost to the satellite; got lost in the ride up to the plungedown...Man sends the ray of the electric light, sends the impulse through the air, down to home...And you can stand on the arms of the Williamsburg Bridge crying "Hey man, well, this is Babylon."And you can fire out on a bus to the outside world, down to Louisiana; you can take her with you.I've seen the rains of the real world come forward on the plain...I've seen the Kansas of your sweet little myth... you've never seen it, no...I'm half-sick on the drinks you mixed through your... true dreams of Wichita.Brooklyn like a sea in the asphalt stalks; push out dead air from a parking garage,Where you stand with the keys and your cool hat of silence...Where you grip her love like a driver's license...

The body like soft serve, dripping down in the June sun,I tried to shoot a thought, but the thought sunk.Nothing to do but scratch words in the dirt and watch the water roll down...Phantom kisses buzzing like the insects.Beads of sweat dripping down on the rent check.My candyland melted down to syrup while I watch the water roll down...Hey the lust comes into phase, but you're down in Marietta.So sweet my mouth was seared, but the words you mouth are sweeter.

Packed my troubles in a suitcaseI was heading for the door thinkingI don't wanna know about itYou said you've had enoughWell I guess baby, I'm out of luck nowI don't wanna know about itHey girl, you took my timePlayed your tricksAnd stole my wineI don't wanna know about itSmile and cheat on meCrazy little woman, are you feeling free nowI don't wanna know about itYou had me waitingBut you deserted meAnticipating
Dreaming comes so easily'Cause it's all that I've knownTrue love is a fairy taleI'm damaged, so how would I know?I'm scared and I'm aloneI'm ashamedAnd I need for you to knowI didn't say all the things that I wanted to sayAnd you can't take back what you've taken away'Cause I feel you, I feel you near meDidn't say all the things that I wanted to sayAnd you can't take back what you've taken away'Cause I feel you, I feel you near meHealing comes so painfullyAnd it chills to the bone
In my head I have dreamsI have visions of many thingsQuestions longings in my mindPictures fill my headI feel so trapped instead butTrapped doesn't seem so bad'Cause You are hereIt doesn't mean anythingWithout You here with meAnd I can try to justifyBut I still need You here with meIn my heart I had hope
Picture the morning taste and devourWe rise early pace up the hourStreets is bustling hustling their heart outYou can't have the sweet with no sourSpices herbs the sweet scent of flowerWe came out precisely the hourClouds disappear the sun shows the powerNo chance of a probable showerI fell in love with my neighbors daughterI wanted to protect and support herNever mind I'm just 12 and a quarterI had dreams beyond our border.Is it true when they say all you need is just love,Is it trueWhat about those who have lovedOnly to find that it's taken awayAnd why do they say that the children have rights to be freeTo be freeWhat about those who I've knownWhose memory still lives inside of me.Fatima,What did the Young Man sayBefore he stole you awayOn that fateful day FatimaFatima,Did he know your nameOr the plans we made,To go to New York City, FatimaAnd after school we studied the lessonsI ask God to slow down the secondsHe does the opposite that's what I'm guessing
When I'm falling downWill you pick me up again?When I'm too far goneDead in the eyes of my friendsWill you take me out of here?When I'm staring down the barrelWhen I'm blinded by the lightsWhen I cannot see your faceTake me out of hereTake me out of hereTake me out of hereTake me out of hereAll I believeAnd all I've knownAre being taken from me
I may never be the reasonThat people come from miles aroundJust to hear that beautiful soundI may never see the seasonWhere people love to hear me speakAnd everybody wants to be meDare I go where I can't seeAnd if I do will You go with meMaybe it's time that I just learn to believe
I found God... on the corner of 1st and AmistadWhere the West... was all but wonAll alone... smoking his last cigaretteI said, "Where've you been?"... He said, "Ask anything".Where were you... when everything was falling apart.All my days... were spent by the telephoneIt never rang... and all I needed was a callThat never came... to the corner of 1st and AmistadLost and insecure... you found me, you found meLying on the floor... surrounded, surroundedWhy'd you have to wait?... Where were you? Where were you?Just a little late... you found me, you found me.
Sometimes it seems the world's unraveling around usWe fear it all my one day come undoneWe can't forget the one who came before usTo forgive the past and bring hope for what's to comeWhen it all comes crashing downThe cross still stands aloneAnd on this our faith is builtAnd our courage is made strongSometimes it seems that i have been forgottenI don't know how i will make it on my ownBut the one who said i will never be forsakenHe still hears my prayer and i will never be aloneWhen it all comes crashing downThe cross still stands aloneAnd on this my faith is builtAnd my courage is made strongWhen the world falls apartAnd you fear for your heart
I'm gonna miss the simple town full of memoriesI'm gonna miss just hanging out with all my friendsThe rainy days and summer nightsSkipping stones by the river sideBut i know. its time to goSo heres goodbye heres so longI must go and follow loveI feel my heart moving onI must go and follow loveCarry on while I'm goneThis is what i've been dreaming ofI miss you soBut i must go, go and follow love
I've had my share of heartacheI've felt the sting of painFrom standing out in the desertPraying for rainI, ve seen my lonely teardropsFall down my lonely faceOh how I long to hear theThunder roll againAnd I want to beSwept away in TheeOnly You know what I need(Chorus)
When I whet my flashing swordAnd my hand takes hold on judgementI will take vengeance upon mine enemiesAnd I will repay those who hate meOh Lord, raise me to thy right hand and count me among thy saintsGoFuck your world and fuck your kindGo fuck yourself, you're fucking barely aliveI used to think of what you meant to meI think of you every fucking dayWhy the fuck did I let you inTo my heart, now where do I begin?Today is my last fucking chanceErase it all and kill my pastFuck what we fucking sharedThe memories don't mean shitDon't give a fuck about what you'll say
You look in my eyes and I get emotional insideI know it's crazy but you still can touch my heartAnd after all this time you'd think that II wouldn't feel the sameTime melts into nothingAnd nothing's changedOh, I still believeSomeday you and meWill find ourselves in love againI had a dreamSomeday you and meWill find ourselves in love againY te amaréCon todo el corazón y la vozYo te amaré con toda mi pasiónY te perseguiré del norte al surA dónde vayas túY rescataré el mundoContigo yo estaréOh, no, no, no, no, noI need you, babyI still believe we can be togetherIf we believe that true love never has to endThen we must know that we will love again
In the merry month of May from my home I started
This is the swiftly tilting planetWhere perfect vision may not offerThe correct point of view; a place whereRight angles may not produceThe correct geometryBy far, a discerning eye is better than a critical mindWe are quiet like birdsWith swiftly tilting mindsAnd wings that are made of humility, yeahWe are quiet like birdsWith secrets like butterfliesAnd we can only fly if we use our wingsBridges are built to get us from where we areTo where we are goingIn order for them to be built inA decent fashion
I am the captain and I have been toldThat tomorrow we land and my ship has been soldNow losing this boat is worth scarce a mentionI think of the crew, most of all the first ensignFor all we learned the seaGuiding a ship, it takes more than your skill
Yeah, there was a time I didn't like the love, I liked the climbersI was no sister then, I was running out of time and one linersAnd I was afraid, like you are when you're too young to know the timeAnd so I watch the way you take your fear and horde the horizonYou point, you have a word for every woman you can lay your eyes onLike you own them, just because you bought the timeAnd you turn to me: you say you hope I'm not threatenedOh, I'm not that pettyAs cool as I am, I thought you'd know this alreadyI will not be afraid of womenI will not be afraid of womenSo now we're at a club, you watch the woman dancing--she is drunkShe is smiling, and she's falling in a slow descending funk
I wonder if Yoko OnoEver thought of staying soloIf she thought of other men andIf she doubted John LennonWorrying that he'd distract her artSitting in the Apple sessionsGiving John her music lessonsChallenging the warring nationsWith her paper installationsDid she guard her Yoko human heartWell, they could talk about meYeah, they could talk about meThrow me to the velvet dogs of pop star historyBut I won't be your Yoko OnoIf you're not good enough for me
Oh my fair North StarI have held to your dearlyI have asked you to steer meTo one cloud scattered nightI got lost in my travelsI met Leo the LionMet and a king and met a giantWith their errant lightThere's the wind and the rainAnd the mercy of the fallenWho say they have no claim to know what's rightThere's the weak and the strongAnd the beds that have no answerAnd that's where I may rest my head tonight
Stopped pretending,Happy ending,Everything I ever wanted,Stands in front of me.I have lost my dreams.I have lost my dreams.
You don't like the sound of the truthComin' from my mouthYou say that I lack the proofWell, baby that might be soI might get to the end of my lifeFind out everyone was lyin'I don't think that I'm afraid anymoreSay that I would rather die tryin'Woh-ohSwing me way down SouthSing me somethin' brave from your mouthAnd I'll bring youPearls of water on my hipsAnd the love in my lipsAll the love from my lips
There's no use in cryingAll my tears won't drown my painFree me from your sorrowI can't grieve you againI watched you let yourself dieAnd now it's too late to save you this timeYou bury me aliveAnd everybody's gotta breathe somehowDon't leave me to dieToo consumed by your own emptiness and liesAll I did was love youNow I hate the nightmare you've becomeI can't let you fool me
It won't go away,These aching memories still dance around me,Spilling over everything with beauty,I see your face in everything before meYour voice is hunting me.Oh I belong with you now,Oh please give in to me,And stay forever,
Watching you sleep for so longKnowing that I can't turn the rain into sunAnymoreI've given you all that I haveNow I stand here too scared to hold your handAfraid you might wake to seeThe monster that had to leave'Cause you see the shelter as the stormHolding wind to keep you warmYou are everything to meThis is why I have to leaveSo sleep well, my angelUnder the ash and the lies
Do you see me, I stand before your eyesHere in pieces, let me in your mindWhen did love fade, why are we at war,Where did we fall, where did we go wrong,Have we lost it all?Oh I let you go to feel the light outsideOh I without you I just feelI just feel so aliveI can define where the well ran dry
Memories fade into the silenceHaunting me tonightWith hopes last breathI take this moment inIt will be the lastWhen morning breaks and sunlight takes the pain awayEver after never came, and I'm still waitingFor a life that never wasAnd all the dreams that I laid to restAre ghosts that keep meAfter all that I've becomeI am only oneI am only one
I've fought another day,Lose another chance to break awayFrom all I cannot bear.I suffer through the shameWishing hope would just abandon meTill this is over.My loveless lifeI'm lost in you tonightWaiting for you to turn aroundOnly to tear the whole world down.Time and time againTake it all and take the fall for you.
Cats and dogs are coming down14th street is gonna drownEveryone else rushing aroundI've got Blonde on BlondeOn my portable stereoIt's a lullabyFrom a giant golden radioI've got no time I want to loseTo people with something to proveWhat can you do but let them talkAnd make your way down the block
Watching terrible tv, it kills all thoughtGetting spacier than an astronautMaking out with people I hardly know or likeI can't believe what I do, late at nightI wanna know what it's likeOn the inside of loveI'm standing at the gatesI see the beauty aboveOnly when we get to see the aerial viewWill the patterns show, we'll know what to doI know the last page so well, I can't read the firstSo I just don't start, it's getting worse
I'm putting this night down to bed'Cause I was sitting at the barHoping you'd walk in the door that says Killian's red'Cause I left you a note that saidCome on out and we'll both get right off of our headsAnd float up off the chairWe'll go on vacation tonightUnder a sun of neon lightAnd I almost love this town when I'm by your sideYou woke me from a long sleep and I'm almost backCloser than ever to finding the hidden trackIf I told you the truth you wouldn't like what I saidI almost believed I was dead
I'm just a happy kidStuck with the heart of a sad punkDrowning in my idAlways searching like it's on junkNo matter who I hang out withI can hear the clack-clunkOf the chains that pull the cars upThe roller coaster mountain top so highWhen it comes down it shoots back upStraight back to the skyI gotta laugh and then I'm asleepAnd then I walk around and wanna cryOut at night to do the strandThe little candles make the bottles glowGot ink all over my right hand
Sit on a train, reading a bookSame damn planet every time I lookTry to relax and slow my heartbeatOnly works when I'm dead asleepBeen thinking and drinking all over the townMust be gearing up for some kind of meltdownAll I am is, a body floating downwind -What's wrong?-Nothing-Are you sure nothing's wrong?-Yeah-But you're sad about something?
My love let we be togetherAnd make a change for the betterOutside is an easy weatherBut inside I feel so cold.Woh yoh how sweet tastes your loverSomething new you must discoverShades of brutalityBut still I walk upright1. Verse (Demba):I surf the world with "Dia" through the red seaIn double sence bubble plans someone calls me from far awayLet me stay to hard my back for the day after.Where camels walk the sunspeed i ride the deserts heatBringing ancient water overdubbed impressions lost in the way back in time.BridgeLaughter filled the air before you desided
Too darkToo dark to seeAnd I can't feel my fingers anymoreI don't think you can save my life again'Cause tonight destiny is at my doorKnocking on my doorToo cold
I'm gonna make the whole world do itI'm hustlin' and take 'em by the heartWon't sufferNot even for one nightYou know there's no reason for alarmNever to late, the sun don't love the day
Sandpaper kisses, papercut blissDon't know what this is, but it all leads to this:You're gonna leave HerYou have deceived HerJust a girlOoh just a girl with featherweight curlsTo expose all she knows you play like tease
I got another gang story to tellPeepAbout how a blackNigga was born in hellAnd right then and there it's no hope'Cause a nigga can't escapeThe gangs and the dopeDamn!And when it's black on blackThat makes it shittyCan't survive in the Compton cityAnd fool that's bet'Cause when you grow up in the hoodYou gotsta claim a setGeah, It's not that you wantTo but you have toDon't be a mark'Cause niggas might laugh youStraight off the mutherfuckin blockCan't deal with bustas soThey asses get clockedGeah, who gives aFuck about anotherOnly got love for myFuckin gang brothersGeah but I'm young soNobody would wonderThat the hood would take me underAlways strapped andEager to peel a capThe hood done took me underAlways strapped andEager to peel a cap
What's goin' on with the sun and the moon'Cause one's goin' down to early, one's comin' up to soonThe hands on my old clock tell me once again that I'm fallin' behindThere's too much to do and not enough timeKeepin' up, I'm movin' as fast as I canKeepin' up, in a circle that never endsI can't stop like it or not I'm stuckIt's runnin' me to death and I'm out of my breath keepin' upThere's no such thing for me as a nine to fiveIt takes more sweat than that just to get us byIt's like I'm chasin' my own tail'Cause Monday mornin' starts another stressed out week
Sometimes the morning coffee's way too strong.And Sometimes what she says she says all wrong.Right or Wrong, she's there beside me,Like only a friend would be!And that's close enough to perfect for me.Now, She's been known to wear her pants too tight.And drinkin' puts her out just like a light.Heaven knows she's not an angel,But she'd really like to be.And that's close enough to perfect for me.
The closer you get, the further I fallI'll be over the edge now in no time at allI'm fallin' faster and faster and faster with no time to stallThe closer you get, the further I fallCould I be dreamin'Is this really real'Cause there's something magicThe way that I feel in your arms tonight
We could walk away now, call it over and doneSay we fought the good fight and nobody wonSay we're both better off that worst came to worstSo we didn't last, hey, we're not the firstBut then again, if we give it one more tryWe might find the feeling can never really dieAnd there's still a chance to be all we might have been
Moon rises and setsIn the real worldIslands and hurricanesWind blows in from JerseyIt floats across the paveInto the open oceanIt's a good dayTo run awayFreedom is a scary thingNot many people really want it
I hear the whispers, babyIf what they say is trueThey say I killed the brotherTo fall in love with youThese wordsI heard them once beforeA conversation I believeHow does a man begin to fallWhen he does practice to deceiveThere was a voice behind my backHis face, I could not see it clearThe voice was so familiar, thoughI knew my enemy was nearI knew my enemy was near
Whenever the light shinesAnd the stillness is shakenAnd the drug of your smile has goneAnd left me aloneI need it badI need it nowWon't you come and give me some?I need it sweetBaby pleaseWon't you answer the phone?

Waiting for the phone to ringDiamond necklace on my shoulderWaiting for the phone to ringLipstick on my naked shoulderIt seems to be my fancy to make it withFranky and Sue AnnOver the bridge we goLooking for loveOver the bridge we goLooking for loveI'll come running to you, hey baby if you want me
StrangeThought I knew you wellThought I had read the skyThought I had read a change in your eyesSo strangeWoke up to a worldThat I am not a partExcept when I can play it's strangerAfter all, what were you really looking for?And I wonder when will I learn, when will I learn?Blue isn't red, everybody knows thisAnd I wonder when will I learn, when will I learn?
The silicon chip inside her headGets switched to overload.And nobody's gonna go to school today;She gonna make them stay at home.Daddy doesn't understand it;He always said she was good as gold.And he can see no reasons'Cause there are no reasonsWhat reasons do you need to be shown?Tell me whyI don't like mondays.Tell me why

Sometimes I think life is just a rodeoThe trick is to ride and make it to the bellBut there is a place, sweet as you will ever knowIn music and love, and things you never tellYou see it in their face, secrets on the telephoneAnd time out of time, for you and no one elseHey let's go all over the worldRock and roll girls, rock and roll girls
They're taking her children awayBecause they said she was not a good motherThey're taking her children awayBecause she was making it with sisters and brothersAnd everyone else, all of the othersLike cheap officers who would stand there and flirt in front of meThey're taking her children awayBecause they said she was not a good motherThey're taking her children awayBecause of the things that they heard she had doneThe black Air Force sergeant was not the first oneAnd all of the drugs she took, every one, every one
Hey now man's own kinWe commend into the windGrateful arms grateful limbsGrateful soul he's gone againI have a winter's taleHow vagrant hearts relent prevailSow their seed into the windSeize the sky and they're gone againFame is fleeting God is nighWe raise our arms to him on highWe shoot our flint into the sunWe bless our spoils and we're gone we're goneHey now man's own kinWe commend into the windGrateful arms grateful limbsGrateful heart he's gone againHere a man man's own kin
We waltzed beneath motionless skiesAll heaven's glory turned in your eyesWe expressed such sweet vowsOh till death do us partOh till death do us part
I was down in GeorgiaNothing was as realAs the street beneath my feetDescending into airThe cauldron was a-bubblingThe flesh was leanAnd the women moved forwardLike piranhas in a streamThey spread themselves before meAn offering so sweetAnd they beckoned and they beckonedCome on darling eatEat the summer cannibalsEat eat eatYou eat the summer cannibalsEat eat eatThey circled around meNatives in a ring
I knew that when I sawThat my life would soon move over from the fast laneGone would be the daysOf all by drinkin' and my carrying onBut when I settled down, the party king uncrownedThis stubborn memory hadn't fadedToo many dumb mistakes and all the grief it makesLeft nothing else to be debatedAnd if you say that you understand then you're lyin'But if you figure that I'm alright now I can't deny itSo I'm on my best behaviorI can't take it anymore

Old Father time checked, so there'd be no doubt;Called on the North wind to come on out,Then cupped his hands so proudly to shout,"La-di-dah di-dah-di-dum, 'tis autumn!'Trees say they're tired, they've born too much fruit;Charmed on the wayside, there's no dispute.Now shedding leaves, they don't give a hoot –

How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved By You)"By Joan OsborneHow sweet it is to be loved by youHow sweet it is to be loved by youI needed the shelter of someone's arms and there youWereI needed someone to understand my ups and downs andThere you wereWith sweet love and devotionDeeply touching my emotion
The bell rings and all thingsAre calling the days pastThe play's castRemember septemberWhen we were togetherTogether, togetherSchooldays, the happy days when we were going nowhereSchooldays, the happy time when we were feeling no careSchooldays when three said that we'd better be friends foreverHow long is ever? Isn't it strange?Schooldays together, why do they change?How long is ever? Isn't it strange?Did kites fly and I spyAnd you cry to run fastOr come lastYou know how we made vowsThey're gone nowWe made friends we broke friendsNo more friends
Working all day, I'm digging up the roads, just working all dayDig for my pay and spend it where I like. I've nothing to sayDrown in my sweat but money buys escape. I've got no regretsWorking all dayWorking all day
Free from the startLeft to departFinding the pleasure and the pain in his artLost in the hushNo need to rushTime waits for him, him who creates with the brushColour the brushHigh in the airHis dreams are thereSearching for answers he will look everywhere
Look around my rooms and see the prizes I have showingWorking hard to build my life and plan the way I'm goingHouse and car and pretty wife they've all been won by knowingAll been won by knowingAll been won by knowing
Why am I using words, no more to say without youClose the door, put out the lights and goLate in the night, in the night your shadow falls between usNevermore, never knowThere, memories are sorrow,When there's no tomorrowSleep while the sweet sorrow wakes my daydream;Sleep while you think of me withKindness, please remember former daysSweet the song that once we sang, the silent parting waysAnd you know, and you know,
Touching the last of what is pastMoving silent water fell the first that comesSlow and winding, flowing freePeaceful music in its sound of distant drumsTrust the shallow virgin streamDanger wild, beware the deeper it becomes
Comes a rain storm put rubbers on your feetComes a snow storm you can get a little heatComes love nothing can be doneComes a fire then you know just what to doBlow a tire you can buy another shoeComes love nothing can be doneDon't try hiding cause there isn't any useYou'll start sliding when your heart turns on the juice
If mine is yours, baby, and yours is mineThen why is yours always so hard to findA king of men and a queen of whoresYou've built your empire on all foursYou give me sorrow in return for love
Turning you on to a world full of shitTwisted beyond a returnFilling our brain with a lot of cocaine'Cos I got money to burnWe know that your world will hate thisThis is what we do to surviveReeking of ether and terminal madness
Open the gates of the pastWith the key to our heartsDream of the years gone byCenturies through mankind's eyesIn the wasteland that grows insideWithin me I shall find myselfSlowly walking, pacing frontSee through these blind eyesStepping on shadows, touching air
What pain will it take?To satisfyYour sick appetiteGo in for the killAlways in sight, preyThe time always right, feastFeed on the pain, tasteSorrow made flesh, sweetLive how you wantJust don't feed on meIf you doubt what I sayI will make you believeShallow are wordsFrom those who starveFor a dream not their own to
I have come back to you brokenTake me homeAnd my body bears this troubleTake me homeTake me back to my beginningBefore the hell of night set inAnd I came to this borderTake me homeI have toured the endless starlightTake me homeI have shattered under midnightTake me homeThere are no vultures in this clearing
Market fresh stand by meWhere will it ever landScar and stains, EmilyTurn our little crabI could have meant it if you let meI could have meant it if you let me
Broken boys look good sitting on their shoesSilent waves responds expose to fearLibrary cards, rented faces, lying on the naked trainHard parades with nothing skinThings that breathe way too thinThey lost their lives in backyardsThey lost their lives in backyardsThey lost their lives in backyardsThey lost their lives in backyardsElevator, red blue stain, best of thingsHalf way between things and times, a killLibrary cards, rented faces, lying on the naked train
Some boys I knowThey speak with broken mouthsI have to sit in side their stomachsTo find out what they're really aboutBut not like the daysWhen the sky is blueAnd all that I hadIs a little of me in a little of you

When I woke up this afternoon,I knew I felt uneasy.But no matter what I'd do,Nothing seemed to please me.I couldn't get out of my head,That little fight we had last night.Though I would much rather be dead than admit to myself,That you were right.Oh, oh, oh, ohDon't be silly,Turn on BillieShe's singing us to sleepSo we can dream our lives away.And if we wake up in full makeupWe'll paint the town blue'Cause baby, red is so passe.Now don't look at me that way.You know I just can't take it.And no matter what they sayI know that we will make it.
La da da da da da da da da dumLa da da da da da dumLa da da da da da da da da dumLa da da da da da dumHow deep is your oceanHow high is your skyI love to put our love into motionBut I have to ask myself why? (why?)I can't tell you how to live your lifeBut I know how to live mineI take home pretty things that I likeAnd baby you are so fineYeah I could give you everything you needWith just one touch of my handBut I swore I would never fall in loveWith a boy in a rock and roll band
You've been around for such a long time nowOh, maybe I could leave you but I don't know howAnd why should I be lonely every nightWhen I can be with you, oh yes, you make it rightAnd I don't listen to the guys who sayThat you're bad for me and I should turn you away'Cause they don't know about usAnd they've never heard of loveI get a feeling when I look at youWherever you go now, I wanna be there tooThey say we're crazy but I just don't careAnd if they keep on talking, still they get nowhere
What's that lying in the leaves so still?An empty shell of selfI'm all alone and dyingIt's just a fatal beating of my heartAnother fatal beating of my heartWhen you look into myEyes you seeA shattered me, you seeAnd if you listen very close, you'll hearA muffled screamA dream you never want to visitIt's just a fatal beating of my heart
Anything but youJust won't doI could carry on foreverUntil I find the truthAnything but youJust won't doI could carry on foreverWhen my heart stands still for a reasonI'm in love with youWhen my heart stands still for a reasonThere's nothing that I cannot doAnd my breathing follows youIn my mind my actions too
FearRummaged through my soul and found no limits.Rummaged through my soul and found no fear.Rummaged through my soul.My eyes are open.Now it seems to shock me, it's so clear.And so you told meYou were open
There's just one thing that I need to sayBefore I close my eyes and walk awayThere's just one thing that I need to feelBefore I walk away against my willThere's just one thing that I need to hearBefore I walk away for the last timeThere's just one thing that I need to seeBefore I take this chance and set us freeDon't forget meDon't regret meDon't suspect meDon't neglect me
You drink your healthAnd remember to forget yourselfSat on a roofIn the everlasting moments of your youthYou looked surprisedAs it all went up in smoke before your eyesBeneath the glowOf a different kind of Sunday morningUntil tomorrowUntil tomorrowUntil tomorrowUntil tomorrowOf a different kind of Sunday morning

Are you with him or all alone tonight.Are you falling in love by candlelight.No I, I don't wanna know.It's time to let go.And baby all those times I've cried alone.Thinking maybe I should call just to see if you're home.No I, don't want this to show.It's time to let go.Watching the heavens, from a window where I sit.But I'm alone this time.Missing the sound of your laughter inside my heart.So I'll just close my eyes.And I never thought it would end like this.I miss the sweetness of your kiss.Now someone else is slowly taking my place.I think about it everyday.Are you with him or all alone tonight.Are you falling in love by candlelight.

Today, we don't know who we areAshamed, hiding behind the scarsToo many times we let the things we feelGet in the way of letting us heal the woundsThat open in the darkDid you ever feel sunlight on your face?Did you ever taste clouds?Did you ever touch space?Did you ever feel sunlight on your face?Did you ever truly live?So walk in time to life's refrainRelax, don't do it to yourself againDecaying yourself with all the love you won't give

Baby, when I think aboutThe day that we first met(The day that we first met)Wasn't lookin' for what I found, but I found youAnd I'm bound to find happiness in bein' around youI'm glad when I'm makin' love to youI'm glad for the way you make me feelI love it 'cause you seem to blow my mind everytimeI'm glad when you walk you hold my handI'm happy that you know how to be a manI'm glad that you came into my life, I'm so gladI dig the way that you get down
You're perfectI just can't control myselfI can't be with no one elseSeems I'm addicted to the way you like to touch meI don't think they understandWhy I love at your commandFrom the words you speakSo deep about it's need I have to have you
Where 69 meets 40There's a single stop light townAnd back when I was really youngA part of that burned downOn any given Friday nightWe'd drive a hundred milesBetween the Sonic and the Grocery StoreLaughing all the whileWith as many friends as I could packIn my daddy's FordBut I ain't in Checotah anymoreMy hotel in ManhattanHolds more people than our townAnd what I just paid for dinnerWould be a down payment on a houseI'd rather be tipping cows in TulsaThan hailing cabs here in New York
When I sleep, I have dreamsAbout the way we used to kissAbout the way you used to hold meAnd say nothin' would ever harm meWhen we first met, oh how you charmed meMade me smile when I was downBig pimpin' around the town, you and meWhenever they'd see you, they'd see meA lover and a friend to me you wereHow did it end? How it hurtsTo not have you in my lifeWhen I wanted to be your wifeYou never know what you have till it's goneTreated you wrong for so longNow you're gone awayBut the love still lives hereStill, I still got love for youStill, after all we've been throughStill, I gave my heart to youAnd baby, you're the only oneThere's other men than youStill, they can come close to youStill, once I said I love you
Hey girl, is he everything you wanted in a man?You know I gave you the world (world)You had me in the palm of your handSo why your love went awayI just can't seem to understandThought it was me and you babe (baby)Me and you until the endBut I guess I was wrongDon't want to think about itDon't want to talk about itI'm just so sick about itCan't believe it's ending this wayJust so confused about itFeeling the blues about itI just can't do without yaTell me is this fair?Is this the way it's really going down?Is this how we say goodbye?Should've known better when you came aroundThat you were gonna make me cryIt's breaking my heart to watch you run aroundCause I know that you're living a lieThat's okay baby cause in time you will findWhat goes around, goes around, goes aroundComes all the way back aroundWhat goes around, goes around, goes aroundComes all the way back aroundWhat goes around, goes around, goes aroundComes all the way back aroundWhat goes around, goes around, goes aroundComes all the way back aroundNow girl, I remember everything that you claimedYou said that you were moving on now (moving on now)And maybe I should do the same (do the same)Funny thing about that isI was ready to give you my nameThought it was me and you, babe (babe)And now, it's all just a shameAnd I guess I was wrongDon't want to think about it (no)Don't want to talk about it (hm)I'm just so sick about itCan't believe it's ending this wayJust so confused about it (uh)
I learned from the pastNot everything lastsI understand that nowEverything changedWhen you walked awayBut I'll survive somehowThough I have regretsI'll learn to forgetAnd just keep moving onCause when love is goneYou have to be strongOnce touched by painYou're not the sameBut time can healYour heart againSo let the cloudsThat bring you downJust fade awayAwaySo I try to smile
I don't want to talk to you anymoreI'm afraid of what I might sayI bite my tongue everytime you come aroundCause blood in my mouth beats blood on the groundHand over my heart I swear I've tried everything I couldWithin all my power two weeks and one hourI slaved and now I've got nothing to showOh if only you'd grow taller than a brick wallFrom now on I'm gonna start holding my breathWhen you come around and you flex that fake grinCause something inside of me has said more than twiceThat breathing less air beats breathing you in
When I close my eyes... I can see for milesThere's comfort in my dark seat... and chaos in the aisles.These eyes are not your eyesAnd these eyes are not the color thatYour arid eyes might be.No, I was not aroundWhen those eyes of yours decided soI refuse to kneel before theSights you choose to see.When I close my eyes... I remember why I smile.
You walked in the roomAnd time was standin' stillKnew you were my destinyBy the way you made me feelOnly you in my lifeForever and todayYou're everything I ever imaginedMy love could beYou for meLike the stars need the skyAnd the river needs it's rainLike an eagle needs it's wingsAnd the fire needs it's flamesLike the sun needs the dayAnd the night needs the moonLike the air that I breatheThat's how I...Dreamed of youI dreamed youIt's hard to explainBut when you know you know
You and me and rain on the roof,Caught up in a summer shower,Drying while it soaks the flowers.Maybe we'll be caught for hours,Waiting out the sun.You and me, we're gathered away
It's really true how nothin' mattersNo mad, mad world and no mad hattersNo one's pitchin' 'cause their ain't no battersIn Coconut GroveDon't bar door, there's no one comin'The ocean's roar will dull the drummin'Of any city thoughts or city wayThe ocean breezes cool my mindThe salty days are hers and mine
Well I know that I have only ever held your handBut just one touch is more than enough to understandThere's a master planAnd although I know I don't believe in destinyMaybe it found meNow my world is filled with so many thingsBut nothing compares to the touch of your skinThere's a symphonyAnd a melody that plays whenever you're aroundI think I've been foundI can see the sunAnd I can feel the rainI can hear the wind call your nameI can feel your loveBut there's one thing I can't doI can't ever get enough of youNow I know that in the past I've been much too keenBut your eyes are the kindest that I've ever seen
I want to thank you my friendFor making me feel worthwhileSweeter than the honey of your lipsAnd kindness in your smileHand in hand we float across the roomExplosions deep insideCheek to cheek, there's clouds under my feetThere's only you and IPlease tell me what you likeDoes that feel niceGive me a signIf you love it I can do it againWe've got the rest of the nightTo get it rightPlease tell me what you likeIf that feels nice give me a signIf you love it I can do it againWe've got the rest of our livesTo get it rightLookin' back on lonely nightsSearching for love again
Oh oh yeah yeahI've been broken, shut down and uselessFeet above me hands in the airYou got me falling over and overYou got me twisted tied up and tangledI do it all for youYou know I've been a fool for youThought I tripped on a shoelaceI look down and it's only youNow i'm standing at a terminal waiting to connect to another planeIf I told you I just cancelled my flight to AmericaWould you call me insane?Everything i am has been neatly containedInto the contents of a Samsonite bagMe a laptop two suitcases and I'm coming to see youWhether you like it or notWhether you like it or notI've been put downPicked up and put offI've been held upPushed and shoved around
Give me a reasonWhy I'm feeling so blueEvery time I close my eyesAll I see is youGive me a reasonWhy I can't feel my heartEverytime you leave my sideI just fall apartAnd when you're fast asleepI wonder where you goCan you tell me I wanna knowBecause I miss youAnd this is all I wanna sayI guess I miss you beautifulThese three words have said it allYou know I miss youI think about you when you're goneI guess I miss youNothing's wrongI don't mean to carry onBut give me a reasonWhy I can't concentrateThe world is turning upside downSpinning round and roundNow give me a reasonWhy I now understandThe beauty and simplicity in everything surrounding me
When the moonlight crawls along the streetChasing away the summer heatFootsteps outside somewhere belowThe world revolves I've let it goWe build our church above the streetWe practice love between these sheetsThe candy sweetness scent of youIt bathes my skin I'm stained of youAnd all I have to do is hold youThere's a racing within my heartAnd I am barely touching you... Oh, oh, oh.Turn the lights down lowTake it offLet me showMy love for youInsatiableTurn me onNever stopWanna taste every dropMy love for youInsatiableOh, oh, oh... oh, yeah.The moonlight plays upon your skinA kiss that lingers takes me inI fall asleep inside of youThere are no wordsThere's only truthBreathe in Breathe outThere is no sound
I've crackedMy temper's spatHot coal, fire and acid jackI've been used I feel abusedSomething you've done has lit my fuseAnd I take my theories backMaybe Karma ain't all thatCoz you do whatever you pleaseEverybody else is left to bleedYou're a heart attackYour heart is blackIt's whackYour mind is jackedHow did anybody ever get like that?You're a heart attackYou stabbed me in the backIf you pull your punches jackI'm taking everything backYou hit me harder than a heart attackWe used to stick togetherYou and me stay that way foreverBut now to my surprise
This frame of mind, young hollow manSaid all I've got to sayDone all I can, won't even tryWon't even showDon't tell me things, I don't want to knowSwim through meMake me more than wholeCome see what I meanMake me feel secureAnd in these days between when I fall apart
Ring out my guilt and hang it on the line,It's been raining all week it won't get a chance to dry,I've been lookin' round the pantry for a box of sorries,I'm all run out yeah, I'm all run out aah,It's not that hard to say I know,I'ts not that hard to say I know,It's not that hard to say, so why can't I say it now?And it's been swellin' up inside like the kitchen sponge,It's in the back of my throat it's on the tip of my tongue,If I could sweep it out the door that would be the end,
You live with a halo 'round your head.This time you're leavingThis place where the walls are painted red.Freedom is what you need.But if the world should ever fall apart around youAnd if you're lost and barely breathing I will find youAnd carry you back home.I won't forsake the only love I've ever knownWhen you're out there on your own.Dark clouds, they surround you in the sky.
Looks like another day,Slipping through my window shade.Chasing the dark away,Seeking into my room again.Are you a sad and lonely thing,Come to steal my piece of mind.The only peace I find,Is pretending your that still laying next to me.So why, why, whyThe suns gotta shine, shine.Why don't it just stay away?Why do dreams have to fade,Into all these shades of blue,Where I wait for you.Pray love reaches through,All these shades, shades of blue.Where you close your eyes,Feel me by your side.I will wait for you,In all these shades of blue.
Here is the place we used to go,We were laughing.Hand in hand walking down the road,We were happy.Here is the corner where said,Kiss me stupid,I remember you in red.We were something again,We were something yea...We would some be...Your in my head,Your under my skin.Your everywhere,But here, but hereIts a mystery,How you can be,Everywhere but...

(Marc Nelson, Jon-John, Darrell Spencer)First chapterYou stole my heart away from meMade me believe true love could beWe were so close you changed my lifeHow could a love so strong not go rightWhere do we go from here?When it's said our love would stay aroundWhy do I even careThe way you looked it can't be foundMy heart is broken down
Somewhere in the night your voice is miles awayRendered from the dust it will be dust againSpoken like a lullabyInfinite as sky on skySomewhere in the night how sweet you sing for meTender as the smile that drifts across your faceFleeting as the wind that passes on the plains
If you don't take me to Paris on a lover's getaway, it's alright, it's alrightIf I'd rather wear your t-shirt than a sexy negligee, it's alright, It's alrightEvery dinner doesn't have to be candlelitIt's kinda nice to know that itDoesn't have to be perfectMaybe every little piece of the puzzle doesn't always fit perfectlyLove can be rough around the edges, tattered at the seamsHoney, if it's good enough for you, it's good enough for meIf your mother doesn't like the way I treat her baby boy, it's alright, it's alright
The heart is a bloomShoots up through the stony groundBut there's no roomNo space to rent in this townYou're out of luckAnd the reason that you had to careThe traffic is stuckAnd you're not moving anywhereYou thought you'd found a friend to take you out of this placeSomeone you could lend a hand in return for graceIt's a beautiful day, the sky fallsYou feel like it's a beautiful dayDon't let it get awayYou're on the roadBut you've got no destination

And you know you shouldn't have another cigaretteBut nothing else makes much sense, nothing else will recompenseAnd you get your loneliness out of a magazineYou never felt nothing at all, no one else need ever knowAnother one has dragged you homeAnd sworn that you're the only oneYou dream they'll play a special partYou write their name upon your heartBut then it's back inside your headThe thought that it will turn out badA fleeting glimpse of what is bound to beDon't paint blue all the timeKnow the truth, read the signsLive your life as a lieYou don't have to die
You doubt your strength or courage, don't come to join with meFor Deth surely awaits you with sharp and pointy teethAn animal so vicious no others fought and wonSo on the fields of battle, we are the chosen onesHuman bones blanket the dirt of the heathen's lairThat we must pass this den of Deth, the only path from hereBut I walk in the light, the time to die has comeNo one shall take my life, I am of the chosen ones
Now before they take me and my blessed lifeNow you'll know why Deth was summoned here tonightI'll recall my perils, they'll kill me in prideNo, I can't run away, there's no place to hideThough too much to live for, I owe enough to dieAsk not for salvation, my death shall mean their livesHatred and guilt, the altar they've built, high priests of sinDestiny, fate, the wicked one's gate beckoning you inBeckoning you inDown the walkways, through the blood-stained townLooking down the cross, bleeding from the crown
I've been down this road walkin' the lineThat's painted by prideAnd I have made mistakes in my lifeThat I just can't hideOh I believe that I am ready for what love has to bringI Got myself together, now I'm ready to singI've been searchin' my soul tonightI know there's so much more to lifeNow I know I can shine a lightTo find my way back homeOne by one, the chains around me unwindEvery day now I feel that I can leave those years behind
I can't stop this feelingDeep inside of meBoy, you just don't realizeWhat you do to meYour lips are sweet as candyThe taste stays on my mindYou just keep me thirstyFor another cup of wineWhen you hold meIn your arms so tightYou let me knowEverything's alrightI'm hooked on a feelingI'm high on believing
I have fallen, I have stood up, I've had the patience of a treeYou have trembled, you have stayed still, you have tumbled like a weedAll the mountains, all the deserts, go for miles and miles aroundWe have driven for years now, baby,Just to get back to a place we had already foundNow you're driving me downtown, baby, on a rainy nightYou're driving me crazy, baby, is this really life?
I don't know what it is that makes me love you soI only know I never want to let you go'Cause you started something, can't you seeThat ever since we met, you've had a hold on me?It happens to be trueI only want to be with youIt doesn't matter where you go or what you doI wanna spend each moment of the day with youLook what has happened with just one kissI never knew that I could be in love like this
La la la la la la la la...La la la la la la la la...I've been thinkingI've been thinking, I've been thinking too muchI just want to live now for a little whileAnd cast my dreams to the windDon't wanna wonderDon't wanna wonder what it's all aboutI'm just working for a living singing with my friendsAs I cast my dreams to the wind
Is his hair still as long?Are his eyes still as blue?Can his face still concealEvery clue to his mood?Does his brow still displayEvery beat of his heart?Did he ask after me?Did you send my regards?Or did you tell him that I? ve diedIn every way that matters?And did you tell him how I cryWith every day that passes?That I am raw and bruised and tornThat I can? t function anymoreWell, did you tell him that?
In a lifetimeMade of memoriesI believeIn destinyEvery moment returns again in timeWhen I've got the future on my mindKnow that you'll be the only oneMeet me half wayAcross the skyOut where the world belongsTo only you and IMeet me half wayAcross the sky

Bones and flesh hair and skinAnd the smell of a kingHe touched you and you fellOnce again like a stonePale blue hands eyes like sunBeams you up lets you downSo you fell once againPretty son like a stone
Lightly come, lightly goSick of your idealized homeI'm only painNot good for youDon't follow me forI'm lost tooAnother day, another wayOnce again I brave the world
In the summer we'd be crazyWe'd fool around all the timeOh how I loved that girlWhen she was mineBut now she'd left meFor another guyAnd it really brought me downFor without that girlI was lost and found

Hi, hello, wake from thy sleepGod has given your soul to keepAll of the power that burns in the flameIgnires the light in a single nameFrederick, name of careFast asleep in a room somewhereGuardian angels line a bedShed their light on my sleepy headI am a threshold yearning to singDown wirh the dancers having on last flingHere's to the moment when you said helloCome on my spirit, are you ready? Let's goHi, hi, hey, hey
I was dreaming in my dreamingOf an aspect bright and fairAnd my sleeping it was brokenBut my dream it lingered nearIn the form of shining valleysWhere the pure air recognizedAnd my senses newly openedI awakened to the cryThat the people have the powerTo redeem the work of foolsFrom the meek, the graces showerIt's decreed the people rulePeople have the powerPeople have the powerPeople have the powerPeople have the powerVengeful aspects became suspectAnd bending low as if to hearWell, and the armies ceased advancingBecause the people had their earAnd the shepherds and the soldiersAnd they laid among the starsExchanging visions, layin' arms
If you got the moneyI think it would be funnyTo take your girl, and spend a bit of your cash for me(I've been watching you)'Cause then she might be happy, and no longer lonelyAnd I could take her out the next day for pretty much freeAn' all the boys they go:Da-dee-doo-da-da-dee-da-doo-dah-dom-dom-de-de-dom-domDom-da-dee-doo-da-da-domDa-dee-doo-da-dee-da-doo-dah-dom-dom-de-de-dom-domDom-da-dee-da-doo-da-da-domI spend late nights trying to pick up loveOff the floor, where the other brothers leave it beThough it's stuck down hard it's like chewing gumWhile a girl on the floor singing R.I.P.'Cause the songbirds don't do singing on pavementsNo sweet melody the sound of spitWe spat, Orbit, spoke of lost hopesSo toot what took man choke on itWe be near heaven at a quarter to elevenBy three we are thinking of the love we lostBy four we be high, thinking of the girl lost secondCheck the odds, was it worth the cost?Do you give a toss?Or are you, looking away?Wondering why you can't eat?Why you never sleep?Drunk all the time?Cold in the heat?
There's no need for introductionsNo dark corridors of fameYou won't find your fortuneYou might find some painI wanna lie, lie togetherFeels like our last embraceIn a world full of confusionYeah, human raceBut I'd rather be here than be anywhereIs there anywhere better than here?You know these feelings I've found, they are oh so rareIs there anywhere better than here?Sometimes life seems to tear us apartI don't wanna let you goSometimes these feelings hit me

Seems like the other dayMy baby went awayShe went awayAcross the sea.It's been two years or soSince I saw my baby goAnd then this letterCame to me.It said that we was throughShe found somebody newOh, lemme think, lemme thinkWhat shall I do?Oh no, oh no, oh no no no no no.RememberWalking in the sand.RememberWalking hand in hand.Remember
Down to who knows who, just to socialize.I'm waiting for my girls, when you caught my eyes.You got no way to make a man honeyYou got to understand.I'm your man, child. Lord Of The Thighs.Well, well, Lordie my God
You see me crying don't let it get'cha downYou see me crying I'm back to the lost and foundHoney what'cha done to your headHoney was the words that I saidHoney what'cha done to your headHoney was the words that I saidYou see me crying say you're a ladies manYou see me crying I'm so hard to understand
Missing the train every morning at 8: 52,Sipping coffee from the same cup as you.The sharing of secrets we thought no one else knew,That's what I miss about you.The new way that love had made me see,Your bashful grin when you asked if I would like your key.The knowing way you used to caress me,That's what I miss about you.
A mask is easily placed,On a betrayed and broken face.A disguise to hide the past,When you mapped out my skin and made the memories last.Some things are never erased,And I have run when I've been chased,By recollections of you and me falling off our homemade castleAnd even when I'm walking straight I always end up in a perfect circle.Oh I try but I just can't wait,To break out of this perfect circle.'Cos giving into old temptation,Is like that common twitch.
How can I think I'm standing strongYet feel the air beneath my feet?How can happiness feel so wrong?How can misery feel so sweet?How can you let me watch you sleepThen break my dreams the way you do?How can I have got in so deep?Why did I fall in love with you?This is the closest thing to crazy I have ever beenFeeling 22, acting 17
In every dream home a heartacheAnd every step I takeTakes me further from heavenIs there a heaven?I'd like to think soStandards of livingThey are rising dailyBut home oh sweet homeIt only a sayingFrom bell push to faucetIn smart town apartmentThe cottage is prettyThe main house a palacePenthouse perfectionBut what goes onWhat to do there
You don't even have to tryIt comes easy for youThe way you move is so appealing, it could make me cryGo out drivin' with my friendsIn Bobby's big old beat up carI'm with a lot of people then I wonder where you areGood times, bad times, gimme some of thatGood times, bad times, gimme some of thatGood times, bad times, gimme some of that
The register stood open as the smoke cleared the roomAnd one man was lying over blood and a broomThe store door was swingin' in a midnight breezeAnd another man ran through the dark and the treesLost in the moment of what he needsLost in the moment of what he needsHe ran past the motel threw his gun in the trashLooked down through the darkness and counted the cashThe man at the store was trying to standLooked up through the white light and reached out his hand
We like to spy on the neighbors.They look so happy together.Funny the power of strangers.Sometimes I wonder if they got it better.Green. Have you seen green?Check out the view from the rooftop.They've got a horse and a big trampoline.Running and jumping till they drop.Down on the ground and they're rolling around in... green.
Even now in heaven there were angels carrying savage weaponsAn eye for an eyeA tooth for a toothRun, run, runBut you sure can't hideDoes our ruin benefit to earth?Does it help the grass to grow?The sun to shine?Is this darkness in you too?Have you'd passed through this night?Run, run, runBut you sure can't hideWhere you're going you're not coming back from
My mind is in a state'Cuz all I seem to do is tempt my fateWell, I try a real spaceBut all the while, I'm crashin' up the gateThis time, this timeReality struck me between the eyes
(Aww)(Yeah)Here is the money that I owe youYeah so you can pay the billsI will give you moreWhen I get paid againI hate those people who love to tell youMoney is the root of all that killsThey have never been poorThey have never had the joy ofA welfare Christmas(Yeah)Oh, I know we will never look back(Yeah)You say you wake up cryingYes and you don't know whyYou get up and you go lay down insideMy baby's roomYeah I guess I'm doing okayI moved in with the strangest guyCan you believe he actuallyThinks that I am really alive?
There's no sign on the gateAnd there's mud on your faceDon't ya think it's time we reinvestigate the situationPut some fruit on you plateYou've forgotten how it startedClose you eyesThink of all the bubbles of love we madeAnd you're down on your kneesIt's too late, oh don't come crawlin'And you lay by my feetWhat a big mistake, I see you fallinGot a buzz in my headAnd my flowers are deadCan't figure out a way to rectify this situation

I'm on my wayCan't settle downStuck in the ways of being an assAnd I got a lot of nerve that I'm ready to passI'm on my wayCan't settle downStuck in ways of sadistic joyMy talent only goes as far as to annoyI'm on my way
Do what I want 'cause I can and if I don't,Because I wannaBe ignored by the stiff and the bored,Because I'm gonnaSpit and retrieve 'cause I give and receive,Because I wannaGonna get through your head,What the mystery man said,Because I'm gonnaHate to say I told you so, all right!Come on!Do believe I told you so
It's been a long and lonely trip but I'm glad that I took it because it was well worth it.I got to read a couple books and do some research before I reached my verdict.Never thought that I was perfect. Always thought that I had a purpose.Used to wonder if I'd live to see my first kiss.The most difficult thing I ever did was recite my own words at a serviceRealizing the person I was addressing probably wasn't looking down from heaven.Or cooking up something in hell's kitchen, trying to listen in or eaves drop from some another dimension.It was self serving just like this is.Conveniently religious on Easter Sunday and on Christmas.The television went from being a babysitter to a mistress.Technology made it easy for us to stay in touch while keeping a distance,'Til we just stayed distant and never touched. Now all we do is text too much.I don't remember much from my youth. Maybe my memory is repressed.Or I just spent too much time wondering if I'd live to have sex.Fell in love for the first time in 4th grade but I didn't have the courage to talk to her.In 8th grade I wrote her the note but I slipped it in someone else's locker.Considered killing myself 'cause of that.It was a big deal. It was a blown cover.It was over for me. My goose was cooked.Stick a fork in me. The jig is up.I blew my chances, the rest is history, our future was torn asunder.It became abundantly clear that I was only brought here to suffer.At least I didn't include my name.Thankfully I wrote the whole note in codeAnd it had 10 layers of scotch tape safety seal making it impossible to open.Plus, it was set to self destruct.Whoever read it probably died... laughing.I wonder if they lived long enough to realize what happened.A year later, I came to understand that wasn't love that I was feeling for her.I had someone else to obsess over.I was older. I was very mature.I forged my time signature while practicing my parents autograph 'cause I was failing math.Disconnected the phone when I thought the teacher would call my home.

Bruised But Not BrokenBeen a lot that I've been throughI've cried a tear a time or two, babyYou know I cried some over youHad my heart kicked to the groundLove ripped me up and tore me down, babyBut that ain't enough to break meCuz I'll rise above itAnd I'll pick myself upAnd I'll dust the pain off my heartChorus:And I'll be alrightAnd I'll love againAnd the wounds will mendI'm bruised but not brokenAnd the pain will fadeI'll get back on my feetIt's not the end of meMy heart is still openI'm bruised but not broken
On the day the wall came downThey threw the locks onto the groundAnd with glasses highWe raised a cry for freedom had arrivedOn the day the wall came downThe ship of fools had finally run agroundPromises lit up the nightLike paper doves in flight
Sometimes I feelI've got to run awayI've got to get awayFrom the pain you driveInto the heart of meThe love that we shareSeems to go nowhereAnd I've lost my lightFor I toss and turnI can't sleep at nightOnce I ran to youAnd now I'll run from youThis tainted love you've givenI give you all a boy could give youTake my tears and that's not nearly allTainted loveTainted love
You can illustrate a life in romanceBut, I can show you something so much more than wordsIn my handsThat's your best intention now, to burn your friends?This is your last night, this is your last chance (In my hands)(Die romantic, romantic)This is the nightmare, we fall asleep(Die romantic, romantic)This is the nightmare we don't completeTonight's the night, and it's all we need now (To die romantic)I sat and watched your heartbeat fade with every breathI watched your lips turn blue,Your eyes went cold and all, with all the restI hold the panic, try to breatheIs this happening?I've fucking had itWell God, save me please'Cuz I don't think she'll make it through the night(Die romantic, romantic)
Trying to create something that's not there.A spark I saw as a bomb is just a means to an end.And I was just so happy to be out of my shell again,Don't think that I really cared for who or what.So for now I'll just have to keep it shut.If you're not ready, you're not ready.Please stop acting like you are.How could I knowThat everything you say are lies about devotion and desire?And I know the spark inside your eyesWas just the match I used to set myself on fire.
Mysterious, blown in with the nightAll this beauty captured in a frameVisibly shaken, but never stirredDrives them insaneI see the way, plays her menAnd I know I've got to know her nameShe's so beautifully brokenShaped by the windDangerously twistedHere I go againI see the way, she casts her spellIt's like drownin' in moonlight
YesterdayAny way you made it was just fineSaw you turn your days into night-timesDidn't you know?You can't make it without ever even tryingAnd something's on your mind, isn't it?Let these timesShow you that you're breaking up your mind
This isn't who I amFrom confidence to self doubt in sixty secondsStorming stages and stereosFrom here to thereTrying to prove that I belongTrying to win approval from people that I don't knowAnd I look so strongWhen the weight of all the world don't take it's tollAnd I'd choose my sides
It's getting cold.Thought it was too soon to tell,But it was terribly old,And as the heartbeat slowsTo a heartless crawl.The lights went out,The lights went outAnd darkness filled the houseOn tiring night under a Long Island sky.I thought I'd known the consequence,But sweetness, can you believe this?This mess we've made of it.This mess we've made of it.In years to come it might make sense,But sweetness, can you believe this?
Drink up beautiful.I spiked your cup with angst and a heart attack,'Cause I've got so much trappedIt's all because of you.So I figured you might like some back.And when I see herI'll tell her what's been on my mindAll these sleepless nights.She'll recite her excusesPut my tail between these legs of mineLike I do all the time.
So you did what you thought was rightOh giving up the fightThe only way that we knew was wrongGot me hanging on and onIt s everything you wantEverything you needAnd the people who counted onLet you down one by oneSo be sure what you re asking forTelephone don t ring no moreIt s everything you wantEverything you need
Le sol a glissé sous mes pas,Je marche dans l'obscurité,Cette nuit, a sonné le glas,Où je pleurerai pour l'éternité.C'est cet endroit nommé le paradis,Qui me délaisse dans le noir,C'est ce dieu qui m'a maudit,Qui me remplit de désespoir.Les moines de ténébreuses pierres,M'ont condamné pour un crime,Mais je pourrai traverser les enfers,Pour Marie, te revoir dans les cimes.
Je ne sais que faire de cette vie,Dans cet enfer au paradis,J'ai perdu mes ailes et ma liberté,A cause de celle que j'ai tant t'aimé,Des larmes de glace sont comme des espoirs,
La tristesse éternelle d'un ange sur la terre,De grandes fontaines de larmes coulant Ã l'infini,Les yeux noirs de cet être, fixant la pierre,Tombée d'une sculpture durant la nuit.L'enfer a doucement touché notre sol,Mais de la mort il est si las,Que même le paradis le désole,Mourir pour cet empire de glace?De roses est recouvert le tombeau,Que foulera l'ange mélancolique,
Des milliers d'âmes tombent du ciel,Et les vies et les morts se mélangent,La terre s'est ouverte de part le cimetière,Ébranlant les croix et les sépultures.Les deux armées se sont unis par le feu,Au milieu des brumes et des vents,Faisant ainsi vaciller le monde,Détruisant la vie et gavant la mort.Les corps tombent du ciel,De sang chaud encore ruisselant,Comme pour nourrir la terre,Affamée par tant de haine.

It's not how fast you can goThe force goes into the flowIf you pick up the beatYou can forget about the heatMore than just survivalMore than just a flashMore than just a dotted lineMore than just a dashIt's a test of ultimate willThe heartbreak climb uphillGot to pick up the paceIf you want to stay in the raceMore than blind ambitionMore than simple greedMore than a finish line (More than a finish line)Must feed this burnin' need (Must feed this burnin' need)In the long runFrom first to lastThe peak is never passedSomethin' always fires the lightThat gets in your eyesOne moment's highAnd glory rolls on by
It's cold and it'sSmooth and it'sA hard shade of whiteAnd everybody needs to lick the surface cleanBut it never tastes betterWhite blooms to white andFreezes white againClose it before something crawls inCommit it, leave it, get away...We alwaysDrop our good side
My box is fullAnd my mouth is fullAnd my life is fullUntil the memory's fullIn how many ways, wordsCan you say nothingIn millions of ways, wordsTo say nothingIn how many ways, words
You use to sayYou wanted someoneTo know you inside outAnd as I look back on thingsWell congradulations, babySomebody knows you nowAll of this timeYou told me you wishedThat you could figure yourself outYou say you're still a mystery
Is it rainin' at your house like it's rainin' at mineDo you miss me like I miss you, is it cloudy all the timeDo you tremble when the phone ringsAnd you think I'm on the lineIs it rainin' at your house like it's rainin' at mine?
It was me on that roadYou couldn't see meToo many lights out but nowhere near hereIt was me on that roadStill you couldn't see meAnd then flashlights and explosionsRoads end getting nearerWe cover distance but not togetherI am the storm, I am the wonder
Are you blind?Blind to me trying to be kind?Volunteering for your firing lineWaiting for one precious signThe flicker of a smileYou should try it just once in a whileBaby, it's not quite your styleIt's simply too easy to doAnd you might not see it throughSee it throughSo find yourself another place to fallFind yourself up against another brick wallSee yourself as a fallen angelWell I don't see no holes in the road but youFind another place to fall
Evening fades to a hazeIt's been several days without youI think about you often all the timeAnd it seems like such a waste of talent being weighedWhile time crawls so slow,It couldn't have love sickness like mineIt *burns* to be the one left behindGive me a sign if you can hear me cryingSend your love back to meFrom wherever you are, straight to the hole in my heartSend your love back to me,From wherever you are,
Yes I hate the way I feelAnd it makes no sense,Five months gone and all I got -Pretty pink flowers on a chain link fence.'Nd I don't like what it means'Cause I knowThere is more to come.I can't go home without chrysanthemum.
Come, comeCome your darknessCome, comeCome your private storm, come, comeYour dark flood's risingI'll be hereI'll be hereI'll be hereCome, comeCome your hollows, come, comeCome to rinse your eyesCome, come
Just a still town girl on a Saturday nightLooking for the fight of her lifeIn the real-time worldNo one sees her at allThey all say she's crazyLocking rhythms to the beat of her heartChanging woman into lifeShe has danced into the danger zoneWhen the dancer becomes the danceIt can cut you like a knifeIf the gift becomes the fireOn a wire betweenWill and what will beShe's a maniacManiac on the floor(On the floor)And she's dancingLike she's never danced before(She's dancing likes...)She's a maniac
City streets passing byUnderneath stormy skiesNeon signs in the nightRed and blue city lightsCargo trains rolling byOnce again someone criesTrains and winter rainsNo going back, no going homeTrains across the plainsAnd in the sky, a star alone
Where are you this moment?Only in my dreamsYou're missing, but you're alwaysA heartbeat from meI'm lost now without youI don't know where you areI keep watching, I keep hopingBut time keeps us apart
I walk the maze of momentsBut everywhere I turn toBegins a new beginningBut never finds a finishI walk to the horizonAnd there I find anotherIt all seems so surprisingAnd then I find that I knowYou go there you're gone foreverI go there I'll lose my wayIf we stay here we're not togetherAnywhere isThe moon upon the oceanIs swept around in motionBut without ever knowingThe reason for its flowingIn motion on the oceanThe moon still keeps on movingThe waves still keep on wavingAnd I still keep on going
Let me sail, let me sailLet the Orinoco flowLet me reach, let me beachOn the shores of TripoliLet me sail, let me sailLet me crash upon your shoreLet me reach, let me beachFar beyond the Yellow SeaSail away, sail away, sail awaySail away, sail away, sail awaySail away, sail away, sail awaySail away, sail away, sail awayFrom Bissau to PalauIn the shade of AvalonFrom Fiji to TireeAnd the Isles of EbonyFrom Peru to CebuHear the power of BabylonFrom Bali to CaliFar beneath the Coral SeaTurn it up, turn it up, turn it up, up, adieuOohTurn it up, turn it up, turn it up, up, adieuOohTurn it up, turn it up, turn it up, up, adieu
Strange how my heart beatsTo find myself upon your shoreStrange how I still feelMy loss of comfort gone beforeCool waves wash overAnd drift away with dreams of youthSo time is stolenI cannot hold you long enough
Cold as the Northern windsIn December morningCold is the cry that ringsFrom this far distant shoreWinter has come too lateToo close beside meHow can I chase awayAll these fears deep inside?

You sayI made you fall in love with meWish I could make you fall in love with youYou believe in the magic that us could beAnd what that you and I means one can doEvery instinct you had said run from meThat this new found touch is uncomfortableAnd to truly stand naked in front of me, or yourselfWell that there matter is something newI take no pride knowingThat you avoid the mirror to shun what you despiseNever knew your beauty you came here withTill the first time you caught your reflection in my eyesNever you mind what I see in youGrow because you're beautiful, not because I need you toGrow till you outstretch every single piece of youHeaven'll see you through but you gotta believe it's trueGo write your storyEven if in the end you might outgrow meI'll always treasure the chapter that was mineI twist through time with a smile knowing you're freePuppy love is real to a puppyI still want to feel you touch me
Will I ever get to, to where it is that I've been going?Will I ever follow through with what I, with what I have planned?I guess it's possible that I have been a bit distractedAnd the directions for me are a lot less in demand, in demandWill I ever get to where I'm going?If I do, will I know when I am there?If the wind blew me in the right direction, yeahWould I even care?I wouldI take a look around
Don't know much about your lifeDon't know much about your world butDon't want to be alone tonightOn this planet they call EarthYou don't know about my past andI don't have the future figured outAnd maybe this is going too fastAnd maybe it's not meant to lastBut what do you say to taking chances?What do you say to jumping off the edge?Never knowing if there's solid ground belowOr a hand to hold, or hell to payWhat do you say?
Every night I grab some money and I go down to the barI got my buddies and a beer I got a dream - I need a carYou got me begging on my knees c'mon and throw the dog a boneA man he doesn't live by rock 'n roll and brew aloneBaby babyRock 'n roll and brewRock 'n roll and brewThey don't mean a thing when I compare 'em next to youRock 'n roll and brewRock 'n roll and brewI know that you and I oh we got better things to doI don't know who you are or what you doOr where you go when you're not aroundI don't know anything about you babyBut you're everything I'm dreaming ofI don't know who you areBut you're a real dead ringer for loveA real dead ringer for loveEver since I can remember you been hanging around this jointYou been trying to look away but now you finally got the pointI don't have to know your name and I won't tell you what to doBut a girl - she doesn't live by only rock 'n roll and brewBaby baby, baby babyRock n' roll and brewRock 'n roll and brewThey don't mean a thing when I compare 'em next to youRock n' roll and brewRock 'n roll and brew

Walk blindly to the light and reach out for his handDon't ask any questions and don't try to understandOpen up your mind and then open up your heartAnd you will see that you and me aren't very far apart'Cause I believe that love is the answerI believe that love will find the wayViolence is spread worldwide and theres families on the streetWe sell drugs to children now, oh why can't we just see?That all we do is eliminate our future with the things we do todayMoney is our incentive now so that makes it okay
I'm keeping an eye on the futureAn eye on the pastAnd the present in my pocketJust in case I need a doorInto a brave new worldWhere all solutions end up with my headBuried to my neck in sand.Enough, enoughBowing down to disillusionHats off and applause to Rogues and EvolutionThe ripple effect is too good not to mention
Mend this careless thread, it's gone askew.Thread on my sweater is pendulous, step back and pull it.Watch it unravel faster than a speeding bullet.Or pull and see how much we can undo.Thread on my sweater is pendulous, step back and pull it.Watch it unravel faster than a speeding bullet.On a burning bridge, yourOptions are minimal at best.Depending on where you're standing,And how much breath is in your chest.If it came down to it,Would you high-tail home and hide?Or dance on fire and enjoy the ride?
There is a light that catches my eye in the morningAnd I see it nowThere aren't any saints, it dreams like it paintsIt's a beautiful storm, it comes with no warning at allI walk the line, tripping each time, and I stumbleBut now that I'm half goneThe world's on the table, I'm willing and ableThis beautiful storm, it comes with no warning at allAnd you stand in the shadowsThe room, dark and narrowI bloom down to the marrowIt's a beautiful storm

You've seen the way I entertain a crowd.I use to pack 'em in for miles around.And I play the happy songs that made 'em smile.Why'd she want to go and change my style?Nobody like sad songs, ones about devise,Songs about broken hearts with tears in your eyes.Nobody like sad songs - since you went away.Seems like sad songs are all I can play.A crowd gets restless, they drift away.Lately no one wants to hear me play.I tried to do the songs I use to do

Breathe and I'll carry you awayInto the velvet skyAnd we'll stir the stars aroundAnd watch them fall awayInto the Hudson BayAnd plummet out of sight and soundThe open summer breezeWill sweep you through the hillsWhere I live in the alpine heightsBelow the Northern LightsI spend my coldest nightsAlone, awake and thinking ofThe weekend we were in love(The weekend we were in love)Home among these mountain topsCan be so awfully dullA thousand miles from the tideBut photos on the walls
Glamor and fashionModels and magazines a striking runway entranceBeauty and passionStardust and high class scenes of popular teensWhen I lived in Denver, I met a millionaireWith ribbons in her blond hairI still remember she was like a princessStraight from a dreamy castle in the airSo lovelyShe was everything to meBoth alone in the darkWe long to see the sunRise over the Bering StraitI was sick of the west
I regarded the world as such a sad sightUntil I viewed it in black and whiteThen I reviewed every frame and basic shapeAnd sealed the exits with caution tapeDon't refocus your eyes in the darknessAnd don't remember this place unless
If we could sit together a momentAnd talk forever just to pass the timeI would smile as the shivers and chillsRun down my spineWhen your eyes are locked on mineOh, we'll fill the metro skies with country airAnd when you close your tired eyes I'll meet you thereI'll meet you thereI'll meet you thereDeep inside of youThere's a ruby glowAnd it gets brighterThan you and I will ever knowTheres a rushing soundThat surrounds us
Are you out there where the rainy daysBegin to feel rather sadAnd the walls are closing inLike the darkness around meIt's so hard to look awayWhen the daylight doesn't ever stayAbove this dull apartment viewOh, I will surround youIt's quite clear that I'm stuck hereSo I'll devise a planAnd cut out a doorIn my new living room floorThe porch light is so brightThat I will quickly sneak downThe dark metal shapeOf the rusty fire escapeI bought a one way ticket
How sick is this?How sick is this?You know, you know, you want to call me backYou know, you know, you want to call me backYou know, you know, you want to call me backOhhHold up I think you're cutting outHold up I think you're cutting outHold up I think I'm losing youHold up I think I'm losing youTell me can you hear me now?Tell me can you hear me now?Tell me can you hear me now?Tell me can you hear me now?We're breakin' up, up, up, upWe're breakin' up, up, up, upWe're breakin' up, up, up, upWe're breakin' up, up, up, upI finally get you on the phone and our connection's all wrongYou are acting like I'm starvin' you out, and my battery is gettin' lowGet me charged up or you will regret itI need to call you back so I can hear you better'Bout to end the conversation altogether, yeahHold up I think you're cutting out
Since you've been gone, since you've been ungluedIt's hard to figure out your next moveOne minute here, the next you're goneLet's make an end to this sad, sad songFor you, it's hard to take'Cause the pill has an awful tasteJust open up and swallow downOnce it hits bottom things may turn aroundUnfortunately, this is the caseYou've got to catch up and win the raceAnd straighten yourself outYou can do it, you're gonna do itJumpin' through it, yeah, yeahEverything you say has been taken wrongEnough to say it's a sad, sad songThey can't understand that you mean to do goodI guess you could say you're misunderstood
In the quickness of our hasteIt seems we forget how to liveThe old blueprintNo longer manifests itselfAs the correct way to existWipe the grime off the view holeAnd please take a closer lookEnvironmental banditsUp to their shenanigansCrooks disguised...We've got to find another wayTo make the world go 'round
YeahI'm on the second floor with a lock on my doorI'm looking at a picture of your faceThe last time I looked you were looking really goodBut somehow pictures fadeThen we're on the phone and we're all aloneBut that just ain't good enoughI go around the world to see your face'Cause this just ain't good enoughSo I'm just kicking it I'm counting the daysI hardly can wait, for us to hang outI'm really missing it in so many waysI anticipate us making outHere comes another oneSip my morning tea but you're not next to meHere goes another day
Go on and baby, get the lighterWe're gonna start the fireThe army of words in meSilent the soldier weepsLying here back to backWaiting for you to reactAnd sometimes, all I need is a good pushRoll over and whisper some goodnessGo on baby, you be the heroNow, can we go back to zero?Go on and get the lighterWe're gonna need some fireLet's get a little higherThe battlefield is tiredThen why all, all that?Go on and baby get the lighterWe're gonna start the fireJust come here and cuddle upI feel a little roughI missed you in my sleepAre you still mad at me?
I try to think about rainbowsWhen it gets badYou got to think about somethingTo keep from going madI try to think about big fat rosesWhen the ship starts going downBut my head is wicked jealousDon't want to talk about it right nowLong distanceDon't talk about ex-girlfriendsDon't talk about you with out meDon't talk about your pastIn my headIt's only in my headIn my headIt's only in my headThere's just something about you
The rope that's wrapped around meIs cutting through my skinAnd the doubts that have surrounded meAre finding their way inI keep it close to meLike a holy man praysIn my desperate hourIt's better, better that waySo I'll come by and see you againI'll be such a very good friendHave mercy on my soulI will never let you knowWhere my mind has beenAngels never came downThere's no one here they want to hang aroundBut if they knewIf they knew you at allThen one by one, the angelsAngels would fall
Bravely, you let go of my handI can't speak, yet, you understandWhere I go now, I go aloneThis path I walk, these days of stoneAnd the angels are callingI must go awayWait for me hereSilently stayAnd don't ask me whyOnly believeThis is not goodbyeAll of my strength, all my desire
I've spent my last nightsStrung up and pulled tight.Holding out, sleep and grow.An answer comes without a please:'Do what you want.'[Chorus:]Wonder why I'm so caught of guard when we kiss.Rather live my life in regret then do this.What happened to the love we both knew?We both chased.Hanging on a cigarette you need me,You burn me you'll burn me.
I'm a suspect, I'm a traitorI'm only here in body visitingYellow faces and the distant screamsThe beauty is in what isn't saidI'm rising to my feetBecause tonight, the world turned in meBecause right now, I don't dare to breatheOh, babe, I knowIt's alive, and somewhere for us to find tonightChase this light with meMy gesso, my last callMy life is yours in your gifted hands
When you're onI swear, you're onYou rip my heart right outYou rip my heart right outI think the whole roomCan hear me clear my throatYou rip my heart right outYou rip my heart right outIf you still care at allDon't go tell me nowIf you love me at allDon't callThen out of nowhereYou put me right back thereYou rip my heart right outYou rip my heart right outAnd we know what happensWhen we get to your houseYou rip my heart right outYou rip my heart right outIf you still care at all

I don't know where the years have goneMemories can only last so longLike faded photographs, forgotten songsAnd the things I never knewWhen the skin is thin, the heart shows throughPlease believe me, what I tell you is true...Where's the light, turn then on againOne more night to believe and thenAnother note for my requiemA memory to carry onThe story's over when the crowds are goneAll my friends have been crucifiedThey made life a long suicide trueGuess we never figured out the rulesBut I'm still alive and my fingers feelI'm gonna play on till the final reel's throughAnd read the credits from a different view
This night is alive with the smell of insaneIts reaching for me and its calling my nameI beg for silence to drown out their weepHow did this asylum become where I sleepSo ashamed of wakingAll my life you failed to keep me safeMy whole world's forsakenWon't let you destroy my faith againAll my Questions get no answersLocked up tight from the world outside meMommy come get me out tonightAll my Questions have no answersI can feel the fear inside meMommy come get me out tonight

Two worlds are within meThey live together just as oneGiving the feeling of existingAnd the means of rulingI despise them bothRefusing to belong to somethingAs a dying slaveI have been reduced to nothingWhy do I still believe in this love?This pathetic silly loveSelfish, coward and pitilessThis I've beenI believe in this loveStronger by your treacheryCoward and pitiless
Through mysterious ages and placesFights and tragedies play outIn front of usWith different meaningsSome fight to surviveOthers to see a faceWhich one is the cruelestNo one knows itNo one can say itIn this warAll your wounds will be mineYour victory my salvationFor you I'm readyTo lose my mindMy death is your resurrectionI'm so eager to touch your skinTo see your eyesTo feel you that I killI killIn this blood I can see

Blood on the sidewalkWashing down the drainRushing around the crime sceneTo hide behind the stainHide behind the painBlue-colored ladyBlack eye behind the shadesIt's funny how the playersThey can't survive the gameI'll survive the gameRule maker, dream takerNumbers on a sheetThe execution, the grand delusion
I was trying to sweep away all my desires,I threw out emotions, my emotionsJust to live in neutrality cause I knowYou only came to leave me, you leave meYou've already see turned backAnd left me/you in this way,I/you don't want to believe you/me, to believe youSo you are/I am far away,Each step that you/I make takes me/you far away,I don't want to trust you
Oh, priestess of my dreams,When under the April moon you appearedStealing my soul and my thoughts,I could have loved to taste your lipsOh, priestess of my dreams Ho,This dark mysterious voiceIs coming out of the night to meMy soul's trembling from flurry
Body lies on the floorVery sick complexionMovements drive your lipsNo more words and no more breathI can feel my tearsRunning on my cheeksI can feel my reasonLeaving my bodyI can feel spiritsTurning above meMy will is not very powerfulAnd my consciousness is fading out
When you try your best but you don't succeedWhen you get what you want but not what you needWhen you feel so tired but you can't sleepStuck in reverseWhen the tears come streaming down your face'Cause you lose something you can't replaceWhen you love someone but it goes to wasteWhat could it be worse?Lights will guide you homeAnd ignite your bonesI will try to fix you

It all started with a stumbleAnd I get old and I get humbleThe sky cracked a million waysMaking me blindAnd as the trees grew higher and higherAnd the fish began to flyI went and stole some wings
My ears are ringingThere's a tingling in the back of my throatCan't stop all the pressure building up in my headIn my headEverybody wants meEverybody needs meEverybody needs me
On a cold day, nothing's gunna stop usOn a cold day, you can see foreverOn a cold day, nothings gunna stop usOn a cold day, you can run through metalIn a graveyard, we'll be making babies
How can it be done?How can we escape from this indigent state?We try for so long, and now I'm afraid it might happen too late.I get the sense you look at me like at some distant star;I never really could accept how taciturn you are.But why does it feelLike the choir is weepingAnd the conductor is reeling?

Look in my eyes what do you see?I'm hanging upside down like a chimpanzeeWhen I'm with my friends riding somewhere on a crowded busThere is nothing that I want to discussI just sit and smile thinking about us
I was never young, even as a child.Said, I was never young; I've always felt beguiled.No, I just never smiledBut you you have a glow,A glow from an inner sense I'll never know.
The language of the frost lobs dead balloons over ruins today,In view of wan wordless crowdsThat chase waifs to spires with fiery plumes,And incite the firmament's portrait of a drowning in StyxThat gives impotents kicks.Boredom murders the heart of our ageWhile sanguinary creeps take the stage...Boredom strangles the life from the printed page.Masking vapor trails from Mercury for a killer on Umbrial,Who crippled birch mares now briars replace their old cotton limbs.Who will tell? I mean, would it make a difference?Look, metal flower-petal tears
You're such a mysteryI just want to stand and stareNibble on your earAnd smell the ocean in your hairYou know you damage meYou leave me tangled in a knot (Oh-oh-oh-oh)But when you reappearI see Neptunian blues that eyes forgot (Eyes forgot)Neptunian blues that eyes forgot (Blues that eyes forgot, eyes forgot)Still, I only feel alive when the VU's flashingAlarms going off in my headI want to grab you and just kiss youMaybe I should sit downNo sense in cashing us nowYeah, I only feel all right when the VU's flashingBombs going off in my headI want to grab you, want to scream at you, no icing me down
Pressing on about our businessComfort is getting too expensiveHot-shots for the pigeons with a death sentenceYou're something like a pistolThat's been polished brightBut if it never leaves the holsterIt can never save your lifeI need a meaning I can get behindA better message to subscribe toSet sun I'm an hour older
On your honor let me explain my behaviorOn your honor I swear I was trying to savorWho's the liar, Who's the killer?You know I was doing a favorWhen I fell upon her by way of a merciful murderWith every warning you wonderDon't have to tell the truthJust keep remaining muteAnd I'll still think for my ownerYes I know what I've done, and what I'm going to do
Don't look back cause there's one more riverDon't turn your back you got one more river to crossNo more fightin' and no more dyin'No more cheatin' and no more lyin'Don't look back cause there's one more riverDon't turn your back you got one more river to cross
I'm a long long way from yesterdayAnd with time my ideals changeI wanna spend all of my timeThe way that it should be spentRoad maps here of twenty townsFlights a faithless placeI eat another milk bar downYawn and wash my faceYou know you're nervous when you see me swayToo much time by yourselfYou know you always seem to back awayDon't hide within yourselfThere's a certain hill I want to climbLike tar bubbles on the pathWhen they all pop up in summertime
I never said I'd prove it, I only said I'd show itI gave you my all, but you wanted moreLost on the inside, filling up the score.I remember playing that one. It's stuck in my head.Over and Over. I took and you bled.
Gone and disapearing on this cold nightI never thought it'd be that wayYour crying eyes they form the questionFormed by the words that we have sharedUncovered signs now change the timesPerplexing incongruent liesUnparalled, impossible, complacent amiable soulsGod, I wanna see you on the insideBut it's not feeling like that wayI wanna see you on the inside
Let's count the days till winter comes our wayAnd we're all tired and ready to breatheAnd there's a rumor that there's a bitter cold chill in the air.It's haunting every breath we take.The hint of alcohol and nicotine keeps us warm inside.So all your fashion sense aware, the sweaters unfold themselves.We are all alone, but we're better off by ourselves.Well it's time to roll the windows down and feel the cold air all around.We are heading out of town and not a thing can stop us now.Get carried away.
You were a face in the crowdI Threw myself onto youI tried to take you awayI didn't know how to doBut I could not give you the mostSome things I said were never trueYet still we clung to a ghostI feel so bad you never knewI felt like you should know but I could not tell you soWhen you walked away I breathed your nameAs you walked awayAs you walked awayWe can never get back what we choose to throw awayWhen you walked away I breathed your nameAs you walked awayAs you walked awayWe can never get back what we choose to throw away
Walking the tightropeNow no consequencesWalking the tightropeNumb and defencelessI knocked on your doorAnd you answered quite quicklySaid I could not come inBut we could walk around the garden togetherArm in arm, enjoying the weatherAnd inspecting the cropsGreen beans in profusion, long and straightBurdering the wine like weeping willowRipe red tomatoes, soft and sweetPerched upon their furry stalkBegging you to pluckCrisp cucumbers proud bell peppers
Break all my bonesI'll learn to walk againBreak all my bonesI'll learn to dance againHere comes the springtimeApril rains bring May bloomsHere comes the timechangeGreen lawns and long afternoonsWipe off all my charms
So this is the end of you and meWe had a good run and I'm setting you freeTo do as you want, to do as you pleaseWithout meRemember when you were my boatAnd I was your seaTogether we'd float so delicatelyBut that was back when we could talk about anythingCause I don't know who I amWhen you're running circles in my headAnd I don't know just who you are
I know where you goWhen you want to fallWhy do you want to be broken?I know where you goWhen you want to fallYes, your friendsThey tell me everythingYes, I know where you goYes, I know what you doYes, I know the awful things you sayAnd who you say them toYes, I know where you goYes, I know what you doI know how you feelYou get crazy insideThey say it runs in the familyI know just how you feelWhen you get crazy insideYour mom she saidThat you are just like meI can see it in your eyesI can see your shaky handsYes, I think you think I'm stupidYou don't think I understand
This is a song about SusanThis is a song about the girl next doorThis is a song about the everyday occurrencesThat make me feel like letting goYes I think we got a problemSo much for the afterglowSo much for the afterglowThis is a song about SusanYeah this is a song about the way things areThis is a song about the scary thingsYou see from the corner of your eyeDon't you wonder why?We never talk about the futureYeah we never talk about the past anymoreWe never ask ourselves the questionsTo the answers that nobody even wants to knowI guess the honeymoon is overSo much for the afterglowSo much for the afterglowSo much for the afterglowSo much for the afterglow
Out of my depthLost in the airFallin fasterLike a broken elevatorOut of my depthLost in the darkWaitin for that other shoeTo come down hardI can not communicateLike i wish i couldI do not deal with my problemsLike i know i shouldI am out of my depthI am out of my leagueWatchin everythinJust slip away from meSomething bad is gonna happenI can feel it deep insideThere are shadows all around meLike a bad moon on the riseI am in over my headI am in too deep & over my head
I wanna go there, I wanna climbNow i don't know about no law, i don't see no crimeAin't no reason, ain't no restI wanna get down to the woman and get undressedAnd i can't stand it, i can't stand itI can't wait to see them walls falling downTell me Jesus, why they run
"Look out the left," the captain said"The lights down there, that's where we'll land"Saw a falling star burningHigh above the Las Vegas sand.It wasn't the one that you gave to meThat night down south between the trailersNot the early one that you wish uponNot the northern one that guides in the sailors.You've got that touch so gentle and sweetBut you've got that look so criticalCan't talk to you babe you know I get so weak
She's my polyrhythmCarryin my heart like the beatSo fast I can't keep upMy prayers sing the melodyShe runs guns everyone wants gunsShe runs guns everyone wants there she goesShe runs guns everyone wants gunsShe runs guns everyone wants there she goesWhy you wanna save me?Lord my soul is taken
You really left your markOn this ol' house, and this ol' heartI see you everywhereAnd when I close my eyes, you're still thereAnd I knowYou want me to move onStart living a new lifeStart writing a new songAnd don't worryI ain't gonna ask youTo come back and love meBaby you don't have to'Cause I can be in love with youWithout you
When there's a shadow you reach for the sunWhen there is love then you look for the oneAnd for the promises there is the skyAnd for the heavens are those who can flyIf you really want to you can hear me sayOnly if you want to will you find a wayIf you really want to you can seize the dayOnly if you want to will you fly awayWhen there's a journey you follow a starWhen there's an ocean you sail from afar
Suddenly before my eyesHues of indigo ariseWith them how my spirit sighsPaint the sky with starsOnly night will ever knowWhy the heavens never showAll the dreams there are to knowPaint the sky with stars
Wow, baby your driving me crazyI said baby your driving me crazyWhen you turn me onThen you shut me downWell, tell me baby can i dress your clownPsychoBaby your driving me crazyI said i'm losing my mind
Now that the "k" is in placeWhere the "c" used to beIt seems that I'm ceasing to beIn a season of the old meI wouldn't trade my placeI got no reason to beWeathered and witheringLike in the season of the old meBust the lock off the front doorOnce you're outside you won't want to hide anymoreLight the light on the front porch
Once in a house on a hillA boy got angryHe broke into my heartFor a day and a nightI stayed beside himUntil I had no hopeSo I came down the hillOf course I was hurtBut then I started to thinkIt shouldn't hurt me to be freeIt's what I really needTo pull myself together
See myself in the pouring homeSee the light, come over nowI see myself in the pouring rainI watch hope come over meHere we are now, going to the east sideI pick up my friends and we start to rideRide all night and we ride all daySome may come, no but some may stayHere we are in the pouring home
Once I had a girlfriendShe made my heart just want to dieShe just couldn't stay insideShe'll make you open up your eyesUntil you've cried yourself a riverThrow your hands up in the skyTo be by her sideI'll do anything if just to make her stayMake her stay, to make her stayStay, count the time until you're mineWill they ever know? We can't deny
I saw the photograph, an image of youThings have never looked, looked like thisIt's never been like thisI'm swimming in grayI'm just swimming in grayLet them all walk away, all walk awaySo there's no one to blame
I am lying in my bedWatching spider eat the flyI say "How is that, It is breakfast even for you"A little later I'm sitting by the window looking outThe red army is really blowing up the streetI'm too stale to eat breakfastSo I smell my fingertipsA cup of coffee won't do for meHow days creep by in the graying skyHow days creep by and they never even tryHow days creep by in the graying skyHow days creep by
Boxing shadows in my sleepIt's the company I keepThe perfect exerciseAs I grow olderI can't believe what God has doneHe took the heat out of the sunAnd now it seems the worldIs growing colder
You're like meWe're both aloneWhat's the problemI don't knowWith the same highThe same eyesBut you can't borrow my clothes all the timeBad thingsDead thingsSad things have to happenSometimes
Couple of young girlsWent sailing down on A1ATo the arms of FloridaSailing down the highwaySinging their heads offProtected by the holy ghostFlying in from the oceanDriving with their eyes closedThe night wants to kiss youDeep and be on his wayPretend that he don't know youVery next dayIsn't it hard sometimes?Isn't it lonely?How I still hang around hereThere's nothing to hold meYou slide down into the seatTwelve hours on you feetGet the tide to wash away
I'd give a 21 gun shot salute...With the toy rifle that you bought me, but it won't shoot.And all is well, because there's been one too many shots.The sterile robots want to talk to me about detox.Stop the presses. There's been an update via 1: 30 AM phone call.When an only half-informative source talks discretely...Meet me... at the family room on the side of the intensive care unit.Immediately... I'll carry a tune, but the siren's so loud I can't hear my music.Keep free... of negative thoughts. Everything'll be fine we all assumed.That is would go back to the way things were. That it would go back to normal soon.
I don't believe itI won't believe itI'm not sadI understand that's how it goesTake it easyThere's no time to be madThat's their jobBlood on their teethDeath on their mindPretty babyPlease just get out of the wayWhere it's safeEyes will follow youWeapons can't break through
Which way can we go, only the moon casts a shadow.When we look far below the path is sharp and narrow.Your thoughts and mine, are far away from this moment, from this moment.

No one seems to care as muchNo time to smile, laugh, or cry as muchHave we lost the touch that means so much?Have we lost the human touch?No one wants to be aloneTo walk or talk and sleep and weep alone

They say the world must end somehow,They say the end's not far from now;I think they're wrong,Don't worry your life away,Start living for today,Don't think about tomorrow.And if the lights go out on all of us,In just a year or two.And if the sky falls down like pouring rain,Then I'll be here with you.

It's buried deep within the past, and I hope it doesn't last(It's something I already chase, I already chase)I try to give it all away, but it's never gonna fade(It's something I don't wanna face, I don't wanna face)I know you feel it's all the same, but I promise that I'll change(It's something I already chase, I already chase)You know I'm trying to believe that you're never gonna leave(It's something I don't wanna face, I don't wanna face)There's nothing left! The fear is gone...And when my heartstrings come undoneI will wait for you, pray for you

We all four grew up togetherIn a small Virginia country townAnd, for some strange reason God only knowsWe got to singin' aroundAnd about twice a year at the National Guard ArmoryOr the old school house we'd go seeThe Blackwood Brothers who were coming to townTo sing especially for meThey always drew a crowd of young folk and old womenAnd men with the mortgage on their homesFarmers and teachers, rich men and preachersThe old school house was full, and they would comeAnd we bought up every album, every picture, every singleTheir autographs were the only things free
We flow with bitter words, sharp our teethWe bite off our own tonguesWe trample any trace of your divinity's hopeWe'll sacrifice our youngWith our eyes sewn shut, now the light can't shineWe'll never wake from deadWhen you beg for us to open up and let you inWe'll cut you out insteadYou promised, you'd give us your wordWe never believed it was trueAnd we pretend that we never heard'Cause we still don't believe in you
I don't belong hereI never saw this on the path I walkThe blood-stained walls, the lines of chalk on the floorIts getting so hardI never saw the backlash, when the tide began to riseI can't rememberThe way it was when everything felt rightMy mouth held shut and eyes sealed tight with controlSo I remember on the insideI found a dark, infernal place, I don't wanna face anymoreSomehow I won't stop feeding the painMy heart's just the same as beforeI found a dark, infernal place, I dont wanna face anymore,And somehowSo now I'm stuck hereBetween the guilty and the insincereThe words I've spoke have left me here all aloneI should have known thisI never saw the backlash, when the tide began to riseI wish it all goneI could've burned it when I had that choice
For the rest of my lifeThere will be no wasted timeToo much to do and to much to seeCan't waste my timeDon't know what tomorrow brings, ooh, oohBut I'm not going to miss anything, ooh ooh
I can tell by the way you walk you wanna be alone with him'Cause you're pacing at an open door, you're waiting and you can't come inWhy do you make up all these storiesMade up your mind, decided for meI can tell by the way you walk you wanna be alone with himWhen you called me on the telephone I knew that you were miles away'Cause the words that you said to me weren't hiding what you couldn't sayPlans sort of changed up for the weekendFriend came to town been years since I seen himI can tell by the way you talk you wanna be alone with him (alone with him)

Saying goodbye is never an easy thingBut you never said that you'd stay foreverSo if you must goWell darlin', I'll set you freeBut I know in timeThat we'll be togetherOh, I won't tryTo stop you now from leaving'Cause in my heart I knowLove will lead you backSomeday I just know thatLove will lead you back to my armsWhere you belongI'm sure, sure as stars are shiningOne day you will find me againIt won't be longOne of these days our love will lead you back
One thousand people sayIt has to be this wayWe never taste our foodOur research goes unprovedOnly geodesic domes can save us nowThe circles that we drawReflect the dreams we sawFar away from town
I didn't know what to sayWhen you happened to look my wayFar from an answer, the question stands aloneThe more that you're after, the more you'll never knowMystery is the only attractionHave you heard the sounds and the reactionsTake me on with perfect harmonyNear or far you're moving closer I seeFollow me, I'll show you the way'Cause you'll never find a reason to staySo just try me if you're willing to play the game
What's the use of standing here when I'm all aloneWhat's the use of waiting here when you're not coming homeDid you see the rain was falling just the other nightIt's over now, step into the lightPicking up from where we left, my heart was left behind
Started at a summer lake,A sentence and a name.If only for a moments sake,You called it and it came.Held him down and let him eat,Longer then a while.Hold it down and let him eat,Softer then a child.We've seen how sick wind blows,But I've got your bovine eyes.And I'll love you like i love you when i die.

You told me you don't love meOver a cup of coffeeAnd I just have to look awayA million miles between usPlanets crash into dustI just let it fade awayI'm walking empty streetsHoping we might meetI see your car parked on the roadThe light on at your windowI know for sure that you're homeBut I just have to pass on bySo no, of course we can't be friends
If I am silentThen I am not realIf I speak up thenNo one will hearIf I wear a mask there'sSomewhere to hideSilence is goldenI have been brokenSafe in my own skinSo nobody winsIf I raise my voiceWill someone get hurt?And if I can't feelThen I won't get touchedIf no truth is spokenThen no lies can hideSilence is golden

I wish I could believe in something biggerMore than these treesThese winds, these oceansI wish I could believe what they tell meI saw, I saw, I saw my brother pack his bags and leaveWe made our goodbyesAnd now he is settled down in the cityWhere he doesn't have to be himselfHe used to play an un-tuned guitarWhile he sang about me and he sung about the starsI used to dream about another timeAnd now it's all clear
This will never end 'cause I want moreMore, give me moreGive me moreThis will never end 'cause I want moreMore, give me moreGive me moreIf I had a heart I could love youIf I had a voice I would sing
A lifetime waiting for the light to shineSuddenly you were here, like an angel appearedAnd the world that I knew changed into a wonderlandThen you called out my name, looked around and I found you were goneLike the rays of the sunDisappeared into never ending nightsWhere everything real has turned to stoneAnd the songbird has flown(You're gone)Now I know a rose can change a shade of blueOoh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeahA shade of blueMy body's hurtin', cryin' and yearnin'Sometimes I feel like I'm losin' my mind
Memory comes when memory's oldI am never the first to knowFollowing the stream up NorthWhere do people like us floatThere is room in my lapFor bruises, asses, handclapsI will never disappearFor forever, I'll be hereWhisperingMorning, keep the streets empty for meMorning, keep the streets empty for me

Don't care what they have to sayNo point in listening to them anywayWhy do you have to give them what they want?They love to watch you as you fall apartStick it to them like a phoenix riseThere's nothing grander than the big surpriseThey can't hurt you with their sticks and stonesAbout time, take them right between the eyesSeek to destroy cause they're scared of youThat's why they try to make a fool of youThey're so jealous of my pretty star/Cause you've got soul inside your shattered heart
Avalanche is sullen and too thinShe starves herself to rid herself of sinAnd the kick is so divineWhen she sees bones beneath her skinAnd she says:Hey baby can you bleed like me?C'mon baby can you bleed like meChris is all dressed up and acting coyPainted like a brand new Christmas toyHe's trying to figure outIf he's a girl or he's a boyAnd he says:Hey baby can you bleed like me?C'mon baby can you bleed like meDoodle takes Dad's scissors to her skin
I wish I had a metal heartI could cross the lineI wish I was half as goodAs you think I amNow that we know for sureThey're telling liesWhen they say no one gets hurt and therefore nobody diesYou know it's hard to believe anything that you hearThey say the world is roundI wish I was as big as youYou'd have to tell the truthI'd be nothing you could hurtNothing you could use
Another saturdayAnother careless moveTells the world thatYou're thinking of what to doA window opens upThen someone calls your nameBut I can tell you don't knowHow to play this gameI know this isn't itYou'll hit your target somedaySo now you're on your ownWon't you come back homeTo see you're not that kindAnd find the strengthTo find the strength
In a few weeks I will get timeTo realise it's right before my eyesAnd I can take it if it's what I want to doI am leaving, and this is starting to feel likeIt's right before my eyesAnd I can taste it, it's my sweet beginningAnd I can tell just what you wantYou don't want to be aloneYou don't want to be aloneAnd I can't say it's what you know
You would look a little better, don't you know?If you just wore less make-upBut it's hard to realize when you're sky highFighting off the spaceshipsSo you're drinking in your room (to make it all go)It didn't end too soon (you've got the next one)You're holding on too long (you've gotta let go)Your other love is gone and you knowIt's too late, it's too lateYou've got another one coming and it's gonna be the sameIt's too late, it's too lateYou've got another one coming and it's gonna be the sameI tried to find a quiet place that we could go
I was wrong, I take it backNow can we get along, give up the slackYou know it all could be much easierBut I'm still travelling, I'm still travellingAnd all the while, the people talkAbout the unsung shit, that they then stopAnd use to please the crowd, the swarming whordes of funThat was in in-turned glassesSo if I'm wrong again, I apologiseYou can take your guest, I'll take out my eyesIt's a common thing, to be out of lineBut it's getting old, by the fifteenth time
Come and talk of all the things we did todayHear and laugh about our funny little waysWhile we have a few minutes to breatheAnd I know that it's time you must leaveBut darling, be home soonI couldn't bear to wait an extra minute if you dawdledMy darling, be home soonIt's not just these few hours but I've been waiting since I toddledFor the great relief of having you to talk toAnd now a quarter of my life is almost pastI think I've come to see myself at last

I've been livin in a room without windowsAway from the sun, no oxygenI couldn't tell if it was day or nightAway from the sun, growing nowhere fastRushing along on the pavementDon't even look at the people's faces, going placesWhen an old man said stopYou nearly stepped on a flowerGrowing through the cracksAnd you didn't even noticeWake up smell the rosesLife is happening and you don't know itWake up, take a momentGrab it in your hands... and own itI realise our love is like that flowerBeen neglecting the thing most precious to meYou've been talking but I haven't been listeningThe static in the noise been drowning you out

Nobody on the roadNobody on the beachI feel it in the airThe summer's out of reachEmpty lake, empty streetsThe sun goes down aloneI'm drivin' by your houseThough I know you're not homeBut I can see youYour brown skin shinin' in the sunYou got your hair combed back and sunglasses on, babyAnd I can tell you my love for you will still be strongAfter the boys of summer have gone

We are childrenAnd we'll give you troubleIf we dont like what you're doingAnd we think that it is wrong.Now we're satisfied,But when we're not...We are taking livesAnd making drones.
Now kid I know I haven't been a perfect manAnd I've avoided doing things I know I canBut if I learned one thing the tattoo on my armWill burn into my thumb It would be thatYou must stick up for yourself sonNever mind what anybody else doneStick up for yourself sonNever mind what anybody else doneStick up for yourself sonNever mind what anybody else doneNow Old Man Schlemming was a formidable foeThe Ambling Alp was too at least that's what I'm toldBut if you learn one thing then learn this well

Born from the light, journey into the momentDelivered from thought and skyHe will be one, one with the landLord of wind and the sea and the sandsThe one, the bringer of lifeAll will bear a part of meLet this hollow shell set your free to live as oneHere we are, children of sun and starsThe first to know and to understandLiving by the law of the agesProphets and sages, forging utopia
Young hearts born with griefShall pay the penalty of truthA season of stolen youthShall teach old hearts to breakIt feels like I've been here beforeHere to where the animals lay down to dieSo we stood alone on a distant store
I stand before thee, gods of all prestineCome forth to see, all things to be seenNow know the presence, and choose thy wrathFor flock of tyrants, who know not thy pathCome now in sweeping vengeanceCome now in needed timeI demand as I stand before youCleanse this worlds decayI demand to know the light of a promised landI demand to see this corrosion wiped awayAnd the slithering beginsAs the shell of men crawl weeping
A deep sore dragged through agesThe sores are my own, I knowWounds collected through a lifetimeAnd wisdom I pick up along the wayI received the spit from a snake
Through times I thought of what we createdFor greater causes that brought us down to thisIn elderly forms and surroundingsIn the flesh of spirits incarnatedThey are here for the hate forgottenA rearview mirror to all lost soulsA slow burn shattered the fieldPain through body fire drained veinA slow burn shattered the fieldPain through body fire drained vein
Can't imagine the pain inside of you.Can't take the violence shooting through.Unleash your rage, pounding fear into their eyesNeuroses piercing through your head. Again and again.Can't take the fuckin' pain.Bury your dead
Sunrise is hours awayPrecious seconds of lifeDrift awayUnnoticed yet perfectSlowly disappearingI have found the edgeHave I found the answer?Truth is my weaponYour anger not enoughI wish to be aloneWith my GodMoving through black watersLeviathan
To rid the earth of the filthTo rid the earth of the liesTo will the rise aboveTearing my insides outI feel my soul go coldOnly the dead are smilingTo rid your heart of all lies
Souls, damned and deserted.Waiting for the lord to call.Sheep who lost their shepherd,Your God deceived you all.Look who he left in charge.The ill-conceived bastard son.Left to die on the cross.For what, for whom?I am all sins
Out of a secret longingThey know their way from hereOut of a growing dreamThey follow the road we createI see what I've cut behind meLost on the bottom, you often found me there
Let me take you down, underneath this false surfaceTonight is the night when we travel into the heart of the unknownNight reveals what is hidden in the shadowsWhat you see is just a shell of me
What the world needs now is love, sweet loveIt's the only thing that there's just too little ofWhat the world needs now is love, sweet loveNo not just for some but for everyone.Lord, we don't need another mountainThere are mountains and hillsides enough to climbThere are oceans and rivers enough to cross
In the evening, when the kettle's on for teaAn old familiar feeling settles over meAnd it's your face I seeAnd I believe that you are thereIn a garden, when I stop to touch a roseAnd feel the petals soft and sweet against my noseI smile and I suppose that somehow maybe you are there
Say it isn't so, say it isn't soEveryone is saying you don't love meSay it isn't soEverywhere I go, everyone I knowWhispered that you're growing tired of meSay it isn't so
Put your hands on the wheelLet the golden age beginLet the window downFeel the moonlight on your skinThe desert windCool your aching headThe weight of the worldDrift away instead
I want you between me and the feeling I get when I miss youBut everything here is telling me I should be fineSo why is it so above as belowThat I'm missing you every timeI got used to you whispering things to me into the eveningWe followed the sun and its colors and left this worldIt seems to me that I'm definitelyHearing the best that I've heardSo throw me a ropeTo hold me in place

[Distant]"Well, I'll take two shots," said the Devil to the ManAnd laid a little book on the barWell, Lord knows the Devil, he only talks shitAnd only drinks whiskey from the jarAnd his hands were rawAnd his eyes were coldAnd his breath was pure alcoholAnd the sound of his voice, it never got oldAnd he talked and talked, talked through the nightJust sippin' his shine 'til the morning lightStumbled into the shade and as he started to goI put three bullets in his back[Normal]

Look at this photographEvery time I do, it makes me laughHow did our eyes get so red?And what the hell is on Joey's head?And this is where I grew upI think the present owner fixed it upI never knew we'd ever went withoutThe second floor is hard for sneaking outAnd this is where I went to schoolMost of the time had better things to doCriminal record says I broke in twiceI must have done it half a dozen timesI wonder if it's too lateShould I go back and try to graduate?Life's better now than it was back thenIf I was them, I wouldn't let me inOh, whoa, whoaOh, God, I-Every memory of looking out the back doorI had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floorIt's hard to say it, time to say itGoodbye, goodbyeEvery memory of walking out the front doorI found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
Never made it as a wise manI couldn't cut it as a poor man stealingTired of living like a blind manI'm sick of sight without a sense of feelingAnd this is how you remind meThis is how you remind meOf what I really amThis is how you remind meOf what I really amIt's not like you to say "Sorry"I was waiting on a different storyThis time I'm mistakenFor handing you a heart worth breakingAnd I've been wrong, I've been downBeen to the bottom of every bottleThese five words in my headScream "Are we having fun yet?"Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, noYeah, yeah, yeah, no, noIt's not like you didn't know that
I like your pants around your feetAnd I like the dirt that's on your kneesAnd I like the way you still say "Please"While you're looking up at meYou're like my favorite damn diseaseAnd I love the places that we goAnd I love the people that you knowAnd I love the way you can't say "No"Too many long lines in a rowI love the powder on your noseAnd now I know who you areIt wasn't that hardJust to figure you out(Now I did, you wonder why)And now I know who you areIt wasn't that hardJust to figure you out(Now I did, you wonder why)I like the freckles on your chest

How the hell did we wind up like this?Why weren't we ableTo see the signs that we missedAnd try and turn the tables?I wish you'd unclench your fistsAnd unpack your suitcaseLately there's been too much of thisBut don't think it's too lateNothing's wrongJust as long as you know that someday I willSomeday, somehowI'm gonna make it all right but not right nowI know you're wondering when(You're the only one who knows that)Someday, somehowI'm gonna make it all right but not right nowI know you're wondering whenWell I'd hope that since we're here anywayThat we could end up saying
He's drunk again, it's time to fightShe must have done something wrong tonightThe living room becomes a boxing ringIt's time to run when you see him clenching his handsShe's just a womanNever againI hear her scream from down the hallAmazing she can even talk at allShe cries to me, "Go back to bed"I'm terrified that she'll wind up dead in his handsShe's just a womanOh, never againBeen there before but not like thisSeen it before but not like thisNever before have I ever seen it this badShe's just a womanNever again
I have returned to northern skiesWhere summer hasn't touchedThe clouds that pass aboveI have returned to sombre greysOf days too early to comeAnd too hurried to stayI have left a million starsAnd an ocean light and clearly blueI have left the warmth of the sunAnd a million adventures not yet begunFor once there was beauty here for meUnder the wide northern skiesAnd once there was magic here for meUnder the wide northern skiesI saw trees as green and this dark as blueHeartbreak and poetry with deeper rootsAnd now I know this is lonely country
If I could write a letter to meAnd send it back in time to myself at seventeenFirst I'd prove it's me by sayingLook under your bedThere's a Skoal can and a PlayboyNo one else would know you hidAnd then I'd say I know it's toughWhen you break up after seven monthsAnd yeah I know you really liked herAnd it just don't seem fairBut all I can say is pain like thatIs fast and it's rareAnd oh, you got so much going for you, going rightBut I know at seventeen it's hard to see past Friday nightShe wasn't right for you and still you feel like there's a knifeSticking out of your back and you're wondering if you'll surviveYou'll make it through this and you'll seeYou're still around to write this letter to me
They will sum it all up in a sentenceA verdict made harder to knowI'm ready to make a commitmentI'm willing to make love to concreteSmilesBruisesSmilesBruisesBars in the wombI hide my dirty minutes under the dirty mattress and they are making me itchMy time is spilt milk
The air is warmI hear the wind and the treesI know I'm there, but I'll never beThe wind is soft tonight, the tide is lowAnd I know the way(I never felt better now)Sometimes life, it moves too slowSlows to a crawl, and then the poetry is lostAnd without speed, hope becomes certaintyAnd for once I'm certain(I never felt better now)
Got that feelingLuck is a little of itI got that feelingI can't stop winningA to zLook what you're missingAs we speakYour numbers risingTake a peakThere's just enough to go aroundGet a pieceYour own little piece of hellGet it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get your goldGet it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get your goldGet it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get your goldGet it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get your gold

Two weeks away it feels like the whole world should've changedBut I'm home nowAnd things still look the sameI think I'll leave it till tomorrow to unpackTry to forget for one more nightThat I'm back in my flat on the roadWhere the cars never stop going through the nightTo a life where I can't watch the sunsetI don't have timeI don't have timeI've still got sand in my shoesAnd I can't shake the thought of youI should get on, forget youBut why would I want toI know we said goodbyeAnything else would've been confused but I wanna see you again
You ask me where I'd go tonightI'd go back to today last yearWe knew how to make each other happyAnd there was hope of everythingIt's hard enough to feel the world as it isAnd hold on anythingWithout these quiet timesYou've bought round hereI'm gonna have to run awayI'm sure that I belong some other placeI've seen another side of all I've seenIt keeps me wondering where my family isIt's hard enough to see the world as it isAnd hold on anythingWithout these quiet times
No more trips to Grafton StreetNo more going thereTo see you lying stillWhile we all come and goNo more watching sunsetsIt seems like summer's holding onAnd no more standing quietly at your windowNo more driving down your roadWondering when you'll be homeAnd no more peace when they all leave

Dialed up his homie mursOn the telephoneGotta talk to somebody who can tell him what the hell is wrongBrain freezing up, he don't know what to doBut the people that know him know that it ain't nothing newCatch five rings, then the answering machineHang up on the bing stare up toward the ceilingStood up to remember that he slept fully dressedSo he grab his keys and put a hat on his rats nestStepped up to that big outsideSomebody once said today's a good day to dieBut he never really was a big fan of their workSo he starts up the walk by kicking sand in the dirtA friend to the stranger a stranger to friendsHe'll take a coffee and a pack of cigarettes when you have a minuteHandle it pay dough the change you keep itHe's a sucker for the morning smile and summer cleavageIf you knew him better he'd ask for some timeCause he's looking for a reservoir to empty his mindAnd there's only so much he can put in a songGotta talk to somebody who can tell him what the hell is wrongAnd this house has got a lotta wallsBut only very few mean anything to youAnd this house has got a lotta wallsBut only very few mean anything to youAnd this house has got a lotta wallsBut only very few mean anything to youAnd this house has got a lotta wallsBut only very few mean anything to youNo shock value to titillateFar from shallow, so demonstrateBlacktop, sidewalk, in the streetCause life is priceless
Every time I look at youYou always look so beautifulDriving on the road again the Chevy's packedAnd it is duskAnd I will take some photographsSo I can dream of youCan't say I've felt such twistingIn my heart this wayWe pitch a tent & have one sleeping bagTo stay awakeThe fire's burning, softly singing songsSo close to youDo you believe in love at first sight?
Take a ride and cut on throughThings will reach you from this placeBarely make your senses trueWould disappear and you can traceYou don't know her name but anywayThis you can't check in, I feel the same
You can read my mindMeet you there sometimeWasted but so fineJust focus on the skyThoughts are going blindLove ain't suicideThe things you always knewBecome so clear to you
Yeah, the summer count can comeBrings you sounds you thought were goneAnd you can try to search aroundAnd you can try to cut it downI found it all but I lost my soul
You make me so good,To be around,Feeling like you should,Wont get you down.I've been crawling through the morning,Soporific, never lazy,Mind's elsewhere, but I ain't crazyFull bliss every time,Receive the sun,It's coming on.Impasses, states collide,

Every time I think I'm gonna wake upBack in the jungleEvery minute I stay in this roomI get weakerEach time I looked aroundThe walls moved in a little tighterI've never seen a man so broken upRipped apartThey say my name is deathI've never seen a man so broken upRipped apartBut I'm alive, I am aliveI've never seen a man so broken up
Carla was on her break from theGraveyard shift at the mayonnaise factoryShe sat at a teetering picnic tableThere was a toxic orange moon and it was slightly coldCarla took out her knife and began etchingRandom words into the table's surfaceThen, she thought of her co-worker JackCarla liked to think of Jack as a luscious apparatusHe was meaty but gracefulHis flesh seemed folded onto his body like a suit made of meatCarla started to think of Jack as a luscious apparatus in a meat suitThinking this gave Carla a dreamy smileHer mouth was small to begin withBut dreaming made it even smallerThat's just how some people areTheir mouths get smaller with dreamsCarla's small mouth was dreamingAs her knife began carving a poem into the tableI like hot voids, smooth pants, lazy beds in the rainI like tongue petals, lather, a blistering sunBut what I like best is the worship of a luscious apparatusWhen Carla was done carving
I can make a perfect picture from a voiceHer serenity oozed into my earIt didn't take long for her to know me, and I knew it felt good"Pick me up and use me, pick me up and use me"She was saying, she sheYou are nothingYou are nothing without meYou are nothingYou are nothing without meIf I am takenYou think that you can live againBut you are nothing
A girl who can't shake off the smellOf a man she met but didn't know wellShe thinks she feels him in her skinShe thinks she sees his sideways grinShe sees him on the street by chanceFollows him as if entrancedGets on a train that he gets onA girl like this she is possessedShe sits two seats behind his own,Can hear him sigh, a little moanShe wonders what he's thinking ofAs he removes his right hand gloveShe notices his hand is strangeAs if the bones were rearrangedShe thinks of what she'll say to himShe hears it playing deep withinYou're all I need to get high
I wanna write myselfOn the walls of your heartBecause the knot that holds usAltogether throws us all apartI'm gonna stop myselfBefore I say something trueBecause the answers that roll from my tongueAre nothing to do with youAnd I hold a piece up to the lightHold a piece up to my eyeFound a missing piece from my setFound a person I'd not metHold a piece up to the lightHold a piece up to my eye
Who wouldn't want a good girlA soft handA gentle woman for a gentleman?He said, "It's been fine so far butAfter a while, I want more than a soft style.I want some slashes to go with those long eyelashes."And so the bedroom became the black roomBut a year later he wanted something moreSomething I wasn't quite prepared forHe said, "Every woman has an itchAnd every nice girl secretly wants to switch."I like how the skins look on your white handsI'd like you to deliver one of my demands."He said, "Every woman has an itchAnd every nice girl wants to switch."
So let's be done with this.You said "I want you,I don't want another,I want a girl who knows how to suffer."Chalk down my hands, I need to work the bars dry.So now you're in the middle of someone terribleAnd you're carrying a tiny crucible.Every raw boy wants relief.You tough guysWith the glass jaws,Your pins, your backstage laws,Your French positions,Your stripper damage.It's more than you can hide,More than you can manage.I'm done with the dark boys,Through with the dark boys,Done with the dark boys,I swear you'll be the last one.I'm done with the dark boys,Through with the dark boys,Done with the black cotton mafia.Last one...I'm done with the dark boys,Through with the dark boys,Done with the dark boys,I swear you'll be the last one.I'm done with the dark boys,Through with the dark boys,Done with the dark boys,I swear you'll be the last one.

Can you see how I cryWill I ever be as good as I once wereIts all the same its always meAnd every time I see you I will have to let you beUsed to think that winter was the worst part to get throughBut now I'm really not so sure anymore
Maybe its too easily fit,No problems are as hard as beforeLook for me under the pillowsHiding from self-created dangerSucking the dustFor what's leftWell go onI'm the last to knowBut don't ask me if it hurts,For I don't knowI've lost sense of painOr I just don't give a damn
Do you wonder where I am?What I kept away?Don't ask againIf you question what I am?Hide away your painDon't ask againDo you miss the way I am?Tell me 'causeI'm coming homeI'm coming home, I'm coming homeI'm coming home, I'm coming home

I have turned away from you and I am Godless.A wasteland of poison.A hidden fortress.I have blackened out the stars and hidden frequencies.I have silenced all the waves and forbidden secrecies.To step into your light.This dog doesn't bite you know.I just want to be your friend.You know I've never been in love before.I've never been in love before.There is nothing of you now.No ghost.No not a trace.No flower not a seed nor perfume in your place.I have searched amidst a barren plane of emptiness.And I am worthless.It is futile.
We're drivingJust me and GodIt's rainingIt's raining hardThe windowsAre steaming upThe bridgeEngulfed by fogThe rest ofThe metal bridgeIt beckonsIt pulls me inI argueI scream at GodFor what he's offeringMy hands fly off the steering wheelCan't recall getting hereIf I could, I would reach behindAnd turn my light onMy thoughts run off the beaten trackThere's no lightHow's the way backTake the hand of GodAnd bite the fearNo more lingering
Listen all you peopleAll you lonely and desertedThe departedAnd the broken-heartedI've got time for youYou can call your friendsFor we're headed on a journeyAll the lonely, the madAll the bad apple sadGot a message for youNothing's peaches and creamNothing's quite what it seemsThey've been lying to youAll you unhappy wivesAll you pregnant bridesAll you geeks and you queensAll you sick and you poorAll the drunks on the floorWell, I'm calling to youListen all you peopleAll you lonely and deserted

Long agoWhen mercury descended high on the moonFar belowWhen little hands are making shapes in the roomThe shadows they danceAnd they cheer up this placeThe faceThat's staring through the tiny crack in the doorEyes so wideHe's never seen a women fall on the floorI swear daddy's killed her this timeShould I made a rocketShould I try to fly awayShould I make a hammerShould I try to smash his faceShould I make a bulletShould I try to shoot the gunI'm sure the judge will let me off real soonLong agoWhen saturn tried to find a way past the sunDeep inside
Day light breaksAnd the black birds callAnd the market stallsAre all filling upSpilling over the streetsHigh aboveOver Notting HillI am floating stillIn a wooden chairWith our restless dogI've been away so long I almost forgotHow time and space cannot replace this feelingOf flying over thingsNow you're falling awake your sleepy face begins to registerThat I'm coming homeYeah I'm coming home to youOn a Sunday only we knowWhere the sunlight and the wind blows
Good morning to you, I hope you're feeling better, babyThinking of me while you are far awayCounting the days until they set you free againWriting this letter, hoping you're okaySaved you the room you used to stay in every SundayThe one that is warmed by sunshine every dayAnd we'll get to know each other for a second timeAnd then you can tell me 'bout your prison stay
Do you remember summer daysJust after summer rainWhen all the air was damp and warmIn the green of country lanes?And the breeze would touch your hairKiss your face and make you careAbout your worldYour summer worldAnd we would count the evening starsAs the day grew darkIn Beechwood ParkDo you remember golden daysAnd golden summer sunThe sound of laughter in our ears
There she sits her hands are heldTight around her glassShe only needs to be aloneShe knows this mood will passTo realize that she was strongAnd he too weak to stayAnd to realize that she is better off this wayBrief candles in her mindBright and tiny gems of memoryBrief candles burn so fineLeaves a light inside where she can seeWhat makes it all worthwhileHer sadness makes her smile
Well I remember yesterdayJust drifting slowly through a crowded streetWith neon darkness shimmering through the hazeA sea of faces rippling in the heatAnd from that nameless changing crowdA sweet vibration seemed to fill the airI stood astounded, staring hardAt men with flowers resting in their hair
I knew her when summer was her crownAnd autumn sad how brown her eyesNow, see her walk byPeppermint coatButton-down clothesButtoned up highDiamonds and stonesHang from her handIsn't she smart?Isn't she grand?I knew her when summer was her crownAnd autumn sad how brown her eyesI knew her when winter was her cloakAnd spring her voice she spoke to me
I close my eyes and soon I'm feeling sleepyI sleep so easyThere's nothing on my mindAnd life seems kind nowI want her she wants meI walk downtown and as I look around meAll around meThe people smile at meIt's plain to see that
The warmth of your love'sLike the warmth from the sunAnd this will be our yearTook a long time to comeDon't let go of my handNow darkness has goneThis will be our yearTook a long time to comeAnd I won't forgetThe way you helped meUp when I was downAnd I won't forgetThe way you saidDarling I love you
When we're all in the crowdAnd you catch her eyeAnd then you both smileI feel so good insideAnd when I'm with herShe talks about youThe things that you sayThe things that you doIt feels so good to know two peopleSo in love, so in loveThey are friends of mine (Joyce and Terry)They are friends of mine (Paul and Molly)And they've got something (Liz and Brian)It's so hard to find (Joy and Davey)They are friends of mine (Kim and Maggie)They are friends of mine (June and Duffy)And they've got something (Jean and Jim)You don't often find (and Jim and Christie)
Well, no one told me about her, the way she liedWell, no one told me about her, how many people criedBut it's too late to say you're sorryHow would I know, why should I care?Please don't bother tryin' to find herShe's not thereWell, let me tell you 'bout the way she lookedThe way she'd act and the colour of her hairHer voice was soft and coolHer eyes were clear and brightBut she's not there
Grey skies and light fadingHeadlamps making patterns on the wallUptown, it's dead now, butOut here no one seems to care at allSick girls and sick boys andEach one lining up to take him homeThey hold tight, their coin andThey pray no one has to see them fallI'm there, yeah, I serve themThe one with the empty looking eyesCome closer, you'll see meThe face that is used to telling liesSaturday nights in neon lightSunday in the cellPills enough to make me feel ill
You dyed your hair this yearYou didn't like the colorLooked the same to meThe same, but only darkerYou cut your hair last yearI find it makes you tallerAnd your face looks smoothYou really do look younger
Well, I met you at the blood bankWe were looking at the bagsWondering if any of the colorsMatched any of the names we knew on the tagsYou said, "See look there, that's yoursStacked on top with your brother'sSee how they resemble one anotherEven in their plastic little covers"And I said I know it wellThat secret that you knewBut you don't know how to tellIt fucks with your honor
I'm up in the woods, I'm down on my mindI'm building a still to slow down the timeI'm up in the woods, I'm down on my mindI'm building a still to slow down the timeI'm up in the woods, I'm down on my mindI'm building a still to slow down the timeI'm up in the woods, I'm down on my mindI'm building a still to slow down the time
No money makers, no promise breakers.People might have to dig for gold.People might line up just to holdOnto a dream I had about love,Where there was you and there was me
I fell in love with a girl of nineteenA black-haired girl I called AbileneYoung girl, where's your husband?Sadly, she replied, I do not have oneThen it's you I'll marry with your parents' permissionNo fine sir, they will not let me marry
Standing with my feet deep in the groundWas I nothing but a landslide in your mind?Am I no one until someone calls me out?Are you just pretending when we talk?You should have seen meKeeping watch at dawn
He motioned to me from across the streetHis arms waving madly "Come over to me"I saw the panic as he approachedWe both ran quickly to the houseWhere the windows were shot outHe lay there bleeding on the floorMy mother beside him screaming "Dear Lord...Someone shot my boy"
When I left you alone to fight your battlesOf long winters and motels what went through your mind?How is it that you made it? How is it that you noticed?It wasn't me who was looking at youThrough foggy glass or windows... it was them.I was out in Coolidge with my head on a counterDrinking down my chance to ever return to anyone.No I wasn't faking it... the hurt I felt was real
I drove from Montesano to Aberdeen.From Aberdeen to Pacific Beach.A pocket full of wrong numbers.Has anybody seen Shannon Rhoads?I see her from the window of my memoryStanding like an angel down the hall.I'll call when I get home this evening.
I stood alone there in the drivewayTill I saw your headlights fadeDisappearBurn out like starsA Chevrolet train that rolls in the nightI must have had a hundred nightmaresOf you falling asleep at the wheelI send my prayers
Broke my heart to leave the cityI mean it broke what wasn't broken in there alreadyThought of all my great reasons for leavingNow I can't think of anyIt's true it was a hard time that I've come throughIt's made me thankful for the bluesHalf my life spent on a highway
On the way to the heaven's lightWhere the time doesn't matterYou're so fineTake my handPut me on the top of the worldOn the way to the heaven's light

Go out and tell the societyThe talk of the town is on its wayThis is not bad only seriousDo understand, don't turn your back on meDoesn't matter heads or tailsPeople know my sins, I'm overwhelmedIt's the darkest night in a long long time I¹ve been up all night and walked up and down the stairsNo complaints, no echoes, I'm trying to be good, ain't trying to behave wellSometimes in the fall, fall, fall, fallThere'll be nothing to keep you far from meBefore I am long long long goneThere'll be nothing to keep me awayEvery night at seven o'clockEvery day at six in the morning tooPeople calling me up hereDidn't even take some time to look at them
I hate the way I cry when you say you miss me.But I love the way you hold me when I sleep.I hate the way I bleed each time you kiss me.But you say "Hey, sleeping beauty, go back to sleep."We had pennies in our pockets,We had hope in our eyes,He said "Girl, you've got a million different faces.So why'd you put on that disguise?"Well, take what you want 'cos I have got nothing.Pass me some pills, I'll go to bed.But, however much I toss and turnI feel a dark place up ahead.Some nights I just sit back here, I remember,I just remember, before it all got lost up in the mess.He said "Not all men are bad and I am not like your dad,And I will hold you even though you're slightly mad.Cos I am not a man who will ever break you."We had pennies in our pockets,We had hope in our eyes,He said "Girl, you've got a million different faces.So why'd you put on that disguise?"
I try not to let my insecuritiesDictate who I am, and who I want to beI gave you all my words, and my words are my soul, soPlease try to be kind if you are in controlBecauseTime takes, time takes, times takesTime takes many tears awayIf I had some elegance, some airs or graceOr if I had buttons made of silverOr tops made of laceThen I'd be that girl you wantI'd ooze with charm and I'd haveDiamonds on my fingers and you on my arm
Whatever it is I do, I try to think about you.I have a love for you that nothing hides.Whatever it is I do, I'm only thinking of you.I hope you look at me through patient eyes.I've become amused.I've become blind.I've become what I know not breathes.You seem illiterate to all my emotions.I stand corrected, how well you read.You speak the truth, you speak the me.You feel the love I have yet to find.I know it's there, I know it's there.But I let the sandcastles kill my mind.Pathetic me, I long to be you.I think I'm close but i stand so far.The turbulent one sheds a turbulent tear.I miss the Love only 'cause they starve'.Oil and water, lust and sympathy.I life and death my way through the sun.Where originates all the pain that leaves,My memory a traumatic sponge and sings to you.Well define my love with attitude.

What a beautiful morningJust to wake up beside youIs something I've missed for so longI'm so glad that you came back homeBaby let me tell youHow my days slipped awayAnd how I was afraid of the nightBut now I'm alrightI feel goodFeeling like a lover shouldWhat else can I sayWon't forget the dayYou came back to stay
Don't, you mess,With a little girl's dream.'Cause she's liable to grow up,Mean.Surprise you to find that I'm laughing?You thought that you'd find me in tears.You thought I'd be crawling,The walls like a tiny mosquito,And trembling in fear.Well, you may be king for the moment,But I am a queen understand,And I've got your pawns and your bishops and,Castles,All inside the palm of my hand.While you were looking the other way,While you had your eyes closed.While you were licking your lips,'Cause I was miserable.While you were selling your soul.While you were tearing a hole,In me.I was taking control.Now I have taken control. (I have... control...)Now I have taken control. (I have... control...)Now I have taken control.Control...This is beginning to feel good,Watching you squirm in your shoes,A small bead of sweat on your brow,And a growl in your belly,You're scared to let through.You thought you could keep me from loving,You thought you could feed on my soul.But while you were busy destroying my life,What was half in me has become whole.
A terrible thought has moved into my mindLike an unwanted room-mate drunk on wineIt feeds on my unhappiness, won't pay the rentI must take proper measures to evict itA terrible thought has moved into my mindA giant rat that's nibbling on my prideIt's tearing away my patience and my witsI must take proper measures to set a trap for itWhat a terrible thoughtI don't care what you've doneI don't care who you've wonI know in the end, you have your fun
My mother spent 10 years sitting by a windowScared if she spoke she would die of a heart attackShe listened as her dreams silently screamedThey drowned like little dolphins caught in a fishnetDear world i'm pleased to meet youHey everybody when you walk the walkYou gotta back it all up you gotta talk the talkHey everybody when I hear the knockDon't wanna measure out my life to the tick of a clockHey everybody when my daddy diedHe had a sad sad story written in his eyesHey everybody when you walk the walkYou cannot measure out your life to the tick of a clockI wanna walk to the beat of my own drumI wanna walk to the beat of my own drumI wanna walk to the beat of my own drumI wanna walk to the beat of my own drumHey everybodyWhen you walk the walk you gotta back it all upBut can you talk the talkHey everybody when I hear the knockDon't want to measure out my life to the tick of a clockHey every Hey everbodyI wanna walk to the beat of my own drums(Say what?)I wanna walk to the beat of my own drums(Say what?)
Wild, wildI go wild, 'cause you break me openWild 'cause you left me hereI go wild 'cause your promises are brokenWild because the chips are downWild because there isn't anybody else aroundWild when the waves start to breakAnd God knows they're breaking in me nowI go wild because it doesn't make senseFor me to cry out in my own defenseAnd wild because I would do anythingTo tear you off your precious fenceSo this is what it's like living in limboFirst I'm high, then I'm so lowI go wild 'cause you break me openWild 'cause you left me hereI go wild 'cause your promises are brokenWild when I know you're nearI go wildI go wild...Tell me what you've come here forMoving like a hunter through my back doorLeaving the perfume of all you adoreTo die nameless on my floorYeah, well we both know that you don't play fairI guess you really think that you'd get me there
Well it's 3 am I'm out here riding againThrough the wicked, winding streets of my worldI make a wrong turn, break itNow i'm too far goneI've got a siren on my tailAnd that ain't the fine I'm lookin forI see a stairway so I follow it downInto the belly of a whale where my secrets echo all aroundYou know me now, but to do better than thatYou got to follow meBoy I'm trying to show you where I'm atHey pretty, don't you wanna take a ride with meThrough my worldHey pretty, don't you wanna kick and slideThrough my worldWell I got a mind full of wicked designsI got a non-stop hole in my head-imagination
It's amazing to me,I can't seem to say what I'm doing here,My tounge is all twisted around the air,I'm looking for words that were so well rehearsed,But I can't find them anywhere.With you, there's no easy answer it's true,You change the equation I add up to,And all of the things that I thought I knew,You turn it around...I'm amazed,When push comes to shove what I'd give to you-Everything.I'm amazed,The hallways I wouldn't mind crawling through,And I'd do it for days and for days.I'm amazed, I'm amazed,I'm amazed, I'm amazed,The places you're taking me to.Wait, I thought I had this down.I built all my cages and my hideout.And I, I covered all my bases,I locked the door,I shut all my windows,
If you were here I know that you would truly be amazedAt whats become of what you madeIf you were hereYou would know how I treasure every dayHow every single word you spokeEchoes in me like a memory of hopeWhen you were hereYou could not feel the value that I placedOn every look that crossed your faceWhen you were hereI did not know just how I embracedAll that you hid behide you faceCould not hide from me 'cause it hid in me too
Looks just like the sunLooks just like itLooks just like the sunLooks just like itBut it looks just like the sunLooks just like itBut I'm breathing, thinking one...Heart is pounding in his chestReaches suddenly for his gunShould be sailing in the westFlower that could be his fun(Keep going)Tree of families on his headWeary red, split open eyes
All the lights we wereAll the lights we wereAll the lights we wereAll the lights we wereDo you rememberHow they need some fruit and sweet heartTo come a time, some time we spent(I cried for we when all was to come freeAt the broken heart in the room)Split your tongue down the semi kindAnd show us lovers that don't love to live
Smeared black inkYour palms are sweatyAnd I'm barely listeningTo last demandsI'm staring at the asphalt wonderingWhat's buried underneath(Where I am)(Where I am)I wear my badgeA vinyl sticker with big block lettersAdhering to my chestThat tells your new friendsI am a visitor here, I am not permanent
Time has had it's way with meMy broken, tired hands can't build a thingThe wires that have held me stillEmbedded now in flesh, define my willThe idle of my days has wonThe empty I have fed has made me numbDespite what you will find in meThe failures of my past still swell beneathI need a heart that carries on through the painWhen the walls start collapsing againGive me a soul that never ceases to followDespite the infection withinOur careless feet leaving trailsNever minding the fragile dirt we all end in
The night she is a true companionThey shuffle inThey hear the soundBut by night's endIt's night's abandonYou look across the floorAin't anyone aroundClosing timeUnplug them peopleAnd send them homeIt's closing timeNow Kenny he's been mixing sound all evening
Rober earl this friend of mineYou know he's always looking after my best interestHe told me lyle p. you need to get some actionGet your head back in lineYou need to get out on your own boyThis hanging around here's got to stopGet out on your own boyAnd take a little trip to the record shopI said the record shopBut robert I don't need no recordsHe just smiled and he saidWhat you need is aRecord ladyRecord ladyShe's got the cutest little cartridgeThat you've ever seenShe's a phonographic dreamI didn't waste no time about itI put on my coat and shoesI packed up my old rocking chairAnd I left them hell on church street bluesAnd I went down to the record shop
Cryptic words meanderNow there is a song beneath the songOne day you'll learnYou'll soon discern its true meaningAn interesting detachmentA listless poem of love sincereDesire, despairOverlapping melodiesAnd it's not a love, it's not a loveIt's not a love, it's not a love song
You're one with the burdon of intuitionYou're one with the freedom of a blank stareYou're one with the best friend you lostYou wish was still thereYou're one with the dust on that old pianoYou're one with the strings on your new guitarYou're one with the wind through the open windowYou areIt was a faint line that brought you hereAnd a pulse that kept you in timeIt was the comfort of a traditionLike the few that were not that kindAnd it's a shame now, baby, you can't see yourselfAnd everything you're running fromAnd it's the same world, honey, that has brought you downAs the one that's gonna pick you up
I made my place by the doorI didn't know what I was waiting forIt felt just like homeExcept no grass, no yard, no pictures hungI could see across to the parkAnd there were friendsThey were laughing hardThey looked just like my own
If you listen to the streamYou may get thirstyIf you watch the dying treeYou may feel weakBut don't you feel sorryDon't you get worriedPlease don't at allDon't you take pityIt's my own faultIf you watch the t.v. screenYou may feel hollow
I never said that it was mineI was just holding itIf i was lonely all this timeWell, i didn't know itAnd if i tried too hardI'd probably blow itThe rest is just a guessIf it's all just luckIt was tough enoughIf we lost some timeThen we'll make it up, up

Sad tyrant, turn on a dimeIn the sultry west coast nightHopping along skid rowAmongst the hopeful and their junkYou showed me so much
Met my old lover in the grocery storeThe snow was falling Christmas EveI stole behind her in the frozen foodsAnd I touched her on the sleeveShe didn't recognize the face at firstBut then her eyes flew open wideShe went to hug me and she spilled her purseAnd we laughed until we criedWe took her groceries to the checkout standThe food was totaled up and baggedWe stood there lost in our embarrassmentAs the conversation draggedWent to have ourselves a drink or twoBut couldn't find an open barWe bought a six-pack at the liquor storeAnd we drank it in her car
Big bang, once upon a goddamnMaking it up like a preacher when the preacher had a planBelieve in the stories, never ask me how I knowFucking the facts with a seemen full of flowLong time ago in an abstract land, where I was all covered in furTill the Lord came down with his holy frown and said:"I'm gonna show you how I mad you."Well I didn't get it, at the moment, and before I knew it, I owned it,A couple of keys, vertical body, dirty words and a cool head.Now all I needed was a girl, all I needed was a girl and a bed...So I said: 'Good God, give me something I can rip,'Cause if you don't, gonna split, gonna leave the sinking ship.'He laughed at me and my mutinous tone,'Cause he could finally get some opposition.And then he, he let me get mine, and then the word 'fine'Was uttered, by many a lip way across time.
It's that second in between, it's the boiling point indeedIt's a supervisor hitting the outlaw on the sceneAnd you'll be ready, when time erased your deeds.What is the use of warning, when nothing can be done?This is how I'm feeling; you kind of hit me numbSwitch the mood to sorrySometimes I am real, sometimes I am faking, what is in between?You were great without warning.You're seeding out my soul.You were caving in; somehow it smelled like rock 'n rollFun to be depraving after all.Boy you are in trouble,For yes, I'm on another levelWhere is the fun, is it all you're living on?Switch the mood to sorry
I'm fine don't believe itYou know me enough to know that's a lieI'm close hard it is to sayTo total this as I barely holding onI need you now I need you don't turn awayI need you now please don't turn me awayI need you I need youOut of here where I've been spinningIt's nearly impossible to slow downOne night of your companyMight be the only thing to keep me saveThe clock is ticking and the fuse is turningCan't keep wondering from what is comingDon't turn me away don't turn me away
While the traveling through this big iron worldIt'll sometimes ask of youTo give advice at certain timesAnd tell folks what to doWell, at this time, I'm gonna tell youWhat's the wisest planWhen it comes to mixing in with thingsThat you just don't understand, hmmLet it alone, let it aloneIf it don't concern you, let it aloneDon't go around putting on airsAnd meddling in other folks' affairsIf you don't know, say soMind your own business and let it alone
I know this girlWho's pretty as can beThe sign of an AquariusShe was born on the 18thUFOs, snakes and spidersGive her the creepsShe's got a half-life and a half smileAnd lives in semi luxuryQuestions God, drugs and bulletsAnd a high school beauty queenShe's courageous but scared to deathBut that's what courage meansShe's looking for some courageShe feels faithless, she feels earthlessShe wants to run
I put my arms around you, your body stalls and droopsI give you consolation but there's nothing I can doEstranged I listen to a voice so scaredLike a martyr from another world, I no longer shareThe anguish of a thousand days, the fear of life like everyoneAgainst there is no chance to swim, you have to simply drift alongEveryday the sting moves deeper, one day it will reach your soul
And it's cold in here when you're all in tearsYour vision is in black and white, you feel so afraidYou fail to show your better half, it's such a shameTomorrow's dream never comes, it remains in shadesRemains in shadesSticks and stones break my bones and it hurts too muchEasy come and easy go, in love and war all seems fair
One hundred million times I said it to youThere's nothing else I will do for youHow many times do you have to hear from meThere's nothing you can do to keep me hereAll violations and degradationsAll confrontations are decimatingI feel so sick inside, I feel so underminedYou hold me to the edge of a knifeYou make me suffer inside
Leave me alone, get out, out of my faceLeave me alone, get out, out of this placeStop haunting me! Stop haunting me!Stay in the shade, keep out of my wayWhat do you want of me? How low can you be?Stop haunting me! Stop haunting me!Just go anywhere the wind blowsJust go anywhere at all
They say, "trust on us"They say, "our time will come"And "your dreams will come alive"One day, we will findNo way to cross this lineIt's where our worlds collideThis world is not made for you and IIt's build on blood and a million liesThis world is not made for you and IIt's build on blood and a million lies
Say what you wantWhat you see is what you getShed your tearsBut never do forgetWhen the chips are downAnd the world is on your backWe'll stick through thick and thinIn spite of our sinsHere and now all is clearYou must face this mounting fearAll our dreams of the past
If you found the words, would you really say them?Or stutter through the verse, with mumbled punctuationRemembering the line, an empty metaphorThat you savored by yourselfYou're never curedIf I forgot the lines, is it easy enough to fake it?Or do you need a moment to rememorizeAnd model it like a curse half disguised?Leers, cheers, whispers and the tearsThat final taste before you're taken awayOdds, ends, final amendsIt's all right to say itJust as long as you don't really think so
Remember boy that your forefathers diedLost in millions for a country's prideThey never mention the trenches of BelgiumWhen they stopped fighting, and they were oneA spirit stronger than war was working that nightDecember 1914 cold, clear and brightCountries' borders were right out of sightThey joined together and decided not to fightAll together nowAll together nowAll together nowIn no man's land, togetherAll together now(All together now)All together now(All together now)All together now(Together, together)In no man's land, togetherThe same old story againAll those tears shed in vainNothing learnt and nothing gainedOnly hope remainsAll together nowAll together nowAll together nowIn no man's land, together

From nowhere through a caravanAround the campfire lightA lovely woman in motionWith hair as dark as nightHer eyes like a cat in the darkThey hypnotize me with loveShe was a gypsy woman, a gypsy womanShe was a gypsy woman, a gypsy womanShe danced around and aroundTo a guitar melodyHer face was all aglow
DaydreamerSitting on the seaSoaking up the sunHe is a real loverOf making up the pastAnd feeling up his girlLike he's never felt a figure beforeA jaw-dropperLooks good when he walksIs the subject of their talkHe would be hard to chaseBut good to catch

Mother, Father, I think that I would ratherStay at home with you for another yearThat building's so tall and it makes me feel so smallThat I might get lost and simply disappearEvil smiles won't change my mindI'm worried and I'm not the worrying kindWhy's that man rubbing his handsLooking at me, writing down his plans?Today I have been molding plasticineAnd I made a little man who looked just like me
It's not found in throwing roses on a graveOr in the cursed bottom of a bottled plagueIt wasn't in the torment that will never fadeBut I see the truth nowThis was my hell living without you hereEven heaven is hell if somehow you were not thereIf you were not thereIt wasn't in the flames that won't stop burning
What is all this? The question I am askingIt's not what is I feel like I was promisedThis hurts, this leaves a lasting lacerationI can't believe that this is what my faith was forThe scars remainReminds of painThe scars remainWhen I see you, I see scars that are matching
Destiny, questioning the connection with someDivinity is there something for me? I'm stretching out my faithI have tasted all the things this world has offered meIt has left me thirsty for something this world cannot seeShine down on meIf you're the one who loved me before the stars were madeShine down on meIf you're the one who gave it all to dethrone my shame
BackstabberYou liar, betrayerI should've known you'd be just like your fatherI know he hurt youBut that's no excuseTo hurt anything and everything that touches youWant more could you wantI was not enoughAnd that was evidentBy the fact thatYou lied to me and you cheated me, repeatedlyYou never loved meI hoped in you, I believed in you, I'd forgiven youIt's all for nothingEverything I knew is deadI won't let you in againToday is the first day of the rest of my life
Looking in this abandoned placeSearching in someone else's faceDon't know what it is but I'll know when I fine itAs I inhale this paradise,Five minutes of escape tonightDon't know what it does but I'll know when it does itEveryone of us is lookingIn a place where peace won't fine us thereEveryone of us is wantingSomething amazing that's in betweenThe living and the dyingAll we have is nowGive us some meaning while we liveSome purpose to dieAll we have is nowGive us some meaning while we live
And this blood on my handsNow it won't go awayI've been out on this road for daysAnd the fear on the wallWatch it slowly cascadeAs the door holds the wolves at bayThe emptiness is building fromThe nothingness that we've all becomeThe emptiness is building from
Like cigarettes and gasolineI light a match and watch this sceneBurn away in front of meThe ashes of my miseryI swear sometimes I think this life is killing meI swear sometimes I think this life is killing meAnd I swear it's killing meAll our shattered hopesAnd our long dead dreamsThe wreckage that we all try to keepFrom coming to lifeAnd tearing us apart at the seamsAt the seamsSun bleached bones and withered treesSlowly rotting just like meEmpty bottles broken glassMy resolve is fading fast
We are young, but we have heartBorn in this world as it all falls apartWe are strong, but we don't belongBorn in this world as it all falls apartI see the children in the rain like the parade before the painI see the love, I see the hate, I see this world that we can makeI see the life, I see the sky, I'd give it all to see you flyYes, we wave this flag of hatred, but you're the ones who made itI watch the beauty of all our lives, passing right before my eyesI hear the hate in all your words, all the words to make us hurtWe get so sick, we're so sick, we never wanted all thisMedication for the kids with no reason to liveSo we march to the drums of the damned as we comeWatch it burn in the sun, we are numbWe are young, but we have heartBorn in this world as it all falls apart
You supply the night babyI'll supply the loveYou supply the night babyI'll supply the loveI see a horseman in the sky

Friday night I'm going nowhereAll the lights are changing green to redTurning over TV stationsSituations running through my headLooking back through timeYou know it's clear that I've been blindI've been a foolTo open up my heartTo all that jealousy, that bitterness, that ridiculeSaturday I'm running wildAnd all the lights are changing red to greenMoving through the crowd I'm pushingChemicals all rushing through my bloodstreamOnly wish that you were hereYou know I'm seeing it so clearI've been afraidTo show you how I really feelAdmit to some of those bad mistakes I've madeIf you want itCome and get it
What on earth is goin' on in my heart?Has it turned as cold as stone?Seems these days I don't feel anythin''Less it cuts me right down to the boneWhat on earth is goin' on in my heart?'Cause my oh my, you know just don't stopIt's in my mind, I wanna tear it upAnd tryin' to fight it, tryin' to turn it offBut it's not enoughIt takes a lotta loveIt takes a lotta love my friendTo keep your heart from freezin'To push on till the endMy oh myWhat on earth is goin' on in my head?You know I used to be so shyYou know I used to be so definiteThought I knew, what love was forI look around these daysI'm not so sure
Take this silver lining, keep it in your own sweet headAnd shine it when the night is burning redShine it in the twilightShine it on the cold, cold groundShine it till these walls come tumbling downWe were born with our eyes wide openSo alive with wild hope nowCan you tell me whyTime after time they drag you downDown in the darkness deepFools and their madness all aroundKnow that the light don't sleep
Sail Away with me honeyI put my heart in your handSail Away with me honeyNow, now, nowSail Away with meWhat will be will beI wanna hold you nowNow, nowCrazy skies all wild above me nowWinter howlin' at my faceAnd everythin' I held so dearDisappeared without a traceOh all the times I've tasted loveNever knew quite what I hadLittle darling if you hear me nowNever needed you so badSpinnin' round inside my headSail Away with me honey

If I lean my weight on itIf I fix my heart to the lineMight find a way from itTo some easy timeMy skins all white with itI'm up so high when I fallI fall so far from itAin't nowhere at allEarly morning sun
Take your eyes off meThere's nothing here to seeJust trying to keep my head togetherAs we make our vowLet us remember hoThere's nothing good that lasts foreverTime out on the running boardsWe're runningThrough a world that's lost it's meaningTrying to find a way to loveThis runningAin't no kind of freedomFeel the touch of griefYou stand in disbeliefCan steal the earth from right beneath you
All my tears will dry awayAll my tears will dry awayAll my tears will dry awayWords don't bother me no moreBlack money falling to the floorFlags out on the balconiesBlack money washing to the seasOh my mind
Aw, Cracklin' Rosie, get on boardWe're gonna ride'Till there ain't no more to goTaking it slowAnd Lord, don't you knowWe'll have me a time with a poor man's ladyHitchin' on a twilight trainAin't nothing here that I care to take alongMaybe a songTo sing when I wantNo need to say please to no manFor a happy tuneOh, I love my Rosie childYou got the way to make me happyYou and me we go in style

Young child with dreamsDreaming each dream on your ownWhen children playSeems like you end up alonePapa says he'd love to be with youIf he had the timeSo you turn to the only friend you can findThere in your mindShilo when I was youngI used to call your nameWhen no one else would comeShilo you always came and we'd play
Hot August nightAnd the leaves hanging downAnd the grass on the ground smellin' sweetMove up the road to the outside of townAnd the sound of that good gospel beatSits a ragged tentWhere there ain't no treesAnd that gospel group tellin' you and meIt's Love, Brother Love, sayBrother Love's Traveling Salvation ShowPack up the babies and grab the old ladiesAnd ev'ryone goes, 'cause everyone knowsBrother Love's showRoom gets suddenly stillAnd when you'd almost betYou could hear yourself sweat, he walks inEyes black as coalAnd when he lifts his face
L.A's fine, sun shines most of the timeAnd the feeling is laid backPalm trees grow and rents are lowBut you know I keep thinkin' aboutMaking my way backWell I'm New York City born and raisedBut nowadays, I'm lost between two shoresL.A.'s fine, but it ain't homeNew York's home but it ain't mine no more"I am", I saidTo no one there

Pretty soon we were takin' it seriousMe and you underneath a mysterious spellNothin' I could do and it suddenly felt like a bolt out of hellI'm tellin' youTo the sound of the beat I was hanging onLike a powerful truth, it was banging on meWouldn't let me goLike a shot in the dark she was hot like a sparkI only knowNeither one of us trying to hold it downNeither one of us taking the middle groundWasn't how to make sense we were thinkin' ofJust the two of us bent on Delirious LoveMe and you being spent on Delirious Love
I'm a man of GodThough I never learned to prayWalked the pathways of the heartFound him there along the wayAnd I am, yes I am, I'm a man of faithAnd faith is something you can't seeBut if we want to make it throughFaith is how it's got to beI'm thanking you Lord for giving me songFor making me strongAnd for taking my handI'll go up to heaven when I reach the endBut up until then

I heard that now you're callin'Left it all behind this mornin'With those blocks, the ones that see you throughLike all the times beforeYou made sure that they saw youBut now you're gonna see this throughWhen you look downYou know you'll see this glory verse
It was strange glue that held us togetherWhile we both came apart at the seamsShe said your place or mineWhile we've still got the timeSo I played along with her schemesBut i don't have the right to be with you tonightSo please leave me alone with no saviour in sightI will sleep safe and sound with no body around meWhen faced with my demonsI clothe them and feed them
It's hard to listen to a hard, hard heartBeatin' close to minePoundin' up against the stone and steelWalls that I won't climbSometimes a hurt is so deep, deep, deepYou think that you're gonna drownSometimes all I can do is weep, weep, weepWith all this rain fallin' downStrange, how hard it rains nowRows and rows of big dark cloudsWhen I'm holding on underneath this shroud
Long black LimousineShiniest car I've ever seenThe back seat is nice and cleanShe rides as quiet as a dreamSomeone dug a hole six long feet in the groundI said goodbye to you and I threw my roses downAin't nothing left at all in the end of being proudWith me riding in this car, and you flying through them cloudsI've had some time to think about youAnd watch the sun set like a stoneI've had some time to think about youOn the long ride home
Mary you're covered in rosesYou're covered in ashesYou're covered in rainYou're covered in babiesYou're covered in slashesYou're covered in wildernessYou're covered in stainsYou cast aside the sheetYou cast aside the shroudOf another manWho served the world proudYou greet another sonYou lose another oneOn some sunny dayAnd always you stayMary
That just means so much, that you'd all come out hereAnd... we're gonna finish up with this songUh... It came to be really weird times in the worldSo, everybody hang in there while you take care of each otherUm, this is a song called "Nobody's cryin'"Well, he jumps in the taxi for the skyHe's off to slay some demon dragonflyAnd he looks at me that long last timeTurns away again and I waved goodbyeIn an envelope inside his coatIs a chain I wore around my throatAlong with a note I wroteSaid: "I love you, but I don't even know whyBut, darling, I wish you wellOn your way to the wishing wellSwinging off of those gates of hellBut I can tell how hard you're tryingI just have this secret hope
Who made up all the rulesWe follow them like foolsBelieve them to be trueDon't care to think them throughI'm sorrySo sorryI'm sorryIt's like thisI'm sorrySo sorryI'm sorryWe do thisAnd it's ironic too'Cause what we tend to doIs act on what they sayAnd then it is that wayI'm sorrySo sorry
Come on closerI wanna show youWhat I'd like to doYou sit back nowJust relax nowI'll take care of youHot temptationsSweet sensationsInfiltrating throughSweet sensationsHot temptationsComing over youGonna take it slow, babeDo it my wayKeep your eyes on meYour reactionTo my action

Been given 24 hoursTo tie up loose endsTo make amendsHis eyes said it allI started to fallAnd the silence deafenedHead spinning roundNo time to sit downJust wanted to run and run and runBe careful they sayDon't wish life awayNow I've one dayAnd I can't believeHow I've been wasting my timeIn 24 hours they'll beLaying flowersOn my lifeIt's over tonightI'm not messing no INeed your blessingAnd your promise to live freePlease do it for meIs there a heaven a hellAnd will I come backWho can tell
I wish this could beA happy songBut my happiness disappearedThe moment you were goneDon't think I ever believed thatThis day will comeNow all I'm feelingIs lost and numbAnd, ohhI know I promisedMmmmmThat I will try butIYes, IMiss youAnd it's killing insideI'll always be thankfulFor the time we hadWe were blessed I should celebrateBut I feel too sad
Said there'd be no going backPromised myself I'd never be that sadMaybe that's why you've come alongTo show me, it's not always badCoz I can feel it, babyI feel like I'm falling for youBut I'm scared to, let goI'm scared coz my heart has been hurt soIt's true I've become a skepticHow many couples really loveJust wish I had a crystal ballTo show me, if it's worth it all
Daylight comes, daylight comes and you've gotta goBreaks my heart, breaks my heart to have to watch you goWish I knew, wish I knew when you'll be back againHowever long it's just too long until we meet againStay now, stay now just a little moreCause this love, this love is what living's forStay now
You can't know, oh noYou can't knowHow much I think about you, noIt's making my head spinLooking at youAnd you are looking at meAnd we both know what we wantHmm, so close to giving inFeel so niceOh yeah, you feel so niceWish I could spend the nightBut I can't pay the price, oh no, noBut I'm flying so highHigh off the groundWhen you're aroundAnd I can feel you're highRocking me insideIt's too much to hide
Say goodbye to the old streetThat never cared much for you anywayThe different colored doorwaysYou thought would let you in one dayGoodbye to the old bus stopFrozen and waitingWeekend edition has this town way overratedWalk across the baseball greenThe grass has turned to strawA flock of birds tries to fly away from where you areGoodbye, goodbye, goodbye, old friendI can't make you stayI can't spend another ten yearsWishing you would anywayHow the sky turns to fireAgainst the telephone wireAnd even I'm getting tired
Tonight I sing soft and lowJust like the moon over the snowI hear icicles falling in the darkIn the darkWe're just like anyone elseWe just want a little bit of sun for ourselvesAnd a little bit of rain to make it all growMaybe a minute or two to get lost in the glow of love
Little pink dress, hanging by her kneesJust overhead on the old trapezeIn the old tent tonight, spotlight going roundOne of these nights the old girl's going downHallelujah, the old girl's going downShe started with us on the back of a horseJust seventeen and already divorcedShe took to the air with the greatest of easeLike she was born to be gliding on the old trapezeSome people don't care if they live or they die
We wait for the bus that's going to BangorIn my plaid dress and burgundy shoesIn your red lipstick and lilac kercheifYou're the most pretty lady in the worldSunThe bus driver smiles, a dime and a nickelWe climb on our seats, the vinyl is cold
Oh, heavenly dayAll the clouds blew awayGot no trouble today with anyoneThe smile on your faceI live only to seeIt's enough for me, baby, it's enough for meOh, heavenly day, heavenly day, heavenly dayTomorrow may rain with sorrow
Don't bring me bad news, no bad newsI don't need none of your bad news todayYou're a sad little boy, anyone can see you're just a sad little boyThat's why you're carrying on that wayWhy don't you burn it all down, burn your own house downBurn your own house downTry to kill your own diseaseAnd leave the rest of us, there's a lot of us, leave the rest of usWho wanna live in peace to live in peace
I went up to the mountainBecause you asked me toUp over the cloudsTo where the sky was blueI could see all around meEverywhereI could see all around meEverywhereSometimes I feel likeI've never been nothing but tiredAnd I'll be walking'Til the day I expire
Have you ever been baptizedIn the cool winter waterOn a Sunday morningWhen the sky was gray?You filed out of the churchyardSo cold it was silverTo gold, tan, and blue carsAnd the cars drove away
Light it up, baby, light up that fireI don't know what's gonna save me from the cold nowAnd these sorrows I'm crying overAnd these sorrows I'm crying overEmbrace me, embrace me with your kind loveIt's all I've ever wanted, all I've ever dreamed ofAnd all of this dreaming of silver and gold
Some people call me the space cowboy, yeahSome call me the gangster of loveSome people call me Maurice'Cause I speak of the pompatus of lovePeople talk about me, babySay I'm doing you wrong, doing you wrongWell, don't you worry, baby, don't worry'Cause I'm right here, right here, right here, right here at home'Cause I'm a picker, I'm a grinnerI'm a lover and I'm a sinnerI play my music in the sunI'm a joker, I'm a smokerI'm a midnight toker
Move a groove, nice and easyFeels so goodThey're in my bonesDance, dance, dance to the musicGet down, get down and sing alongTop40db: The most accurate lyrics site on the net.Cause it ain't gonna hurt
Anger inside builds within my bodyWhy you hate me? What have I done?You tried to hit me!Scream at me again, if you like?Throw your hate at me, with all your mightHit me 'cause I'm strange, hit meTell me I'm a pussy and you're harder than meWhat's with you boy? Think hardA tattooed body to hide who you areScared to be honest, be yourselfA cowardly manI don't run around trying to be what's not within meLook into my eyes, I am free
The whispers in the morningOf lovers sleeping tightAre rolling by like thunder nowAs I look in your eyesI hold on to your whole bodyAnd feel each move you makeYour voice is warm and tenderA love that I could not forsake'Cause I'm your ladyAnd you are my manWhenever you reach for meI'll do all that I canLost is how I'm feeling lying in your armsWhen the world outside's too much to takeThat all ends when I'm with youEven though there may be timesIt seems I'm far away
Used to be that I believed in somethingUsed to be that I believed in loveIt's been a long time since I've had that feelingI could love someoneI could trust someoneI said I'd never let nobody near my heart again darlin'I said I'd never let nobody in, butIf you asked me toI just might change my mind and let you in my life, foreverIf you asked me toI just might give my heart and stay here in your arms foreverIf you asked me toIf you asked me toOh, yeahSomehow ever since I've been around you
There were nights when the wind was so coldThat my body froze in bedIf I just listened to it right outside the windowThere were days when the sun was so cruelThat all the tears turned to dustAnd I just knew my eyes were drying up foreverI finished crying in the instant that you leftAnd I can't remember where or when or howAnd I banished every memory you and I had ever madeBut when you touch me like thisAnd you hold me like thatI just have to admitThat it's all coming back to meWhen I touch you like thisAnd I hold you like thatIt's so hard to believe butIt's all coming back to meIt's all coming backIt's all coming back to me nowThere were moments of goldAnd there were flashes of lightThere were things I'd never do againBut then they'd always seemed rightThere were nights of endless pleasureIt was more than any laws allowBaby, babyIf I kiss you like thisAnd if you whisper like thatIt was lost long agoBut it's all coming back to meIf you want me like thisAnd if you need me like thatIt was dead long ago
The first time ever I saw your faceI thought the Sun rose in your eyesAnd the moon and the stars were the gifts you gaveTo the dark and the empty skies my loveThe first time ever I kissed your mouth
I was just thinkin'That I have been missin' you for way too longAnd there is somethin' inside this weary headThat wants us to love just insteadBut I was just thinkin'Merely thinkin'I've got loads of pictures, yeahI've got the one of you in that dancin' dressBut man, I feel silly in that dim lightJust after doin' you by the side of my Kodak delightsI am sinkin'Merely sinkin'Yeah, I think about long distance rates instead of kissin' you babe
You could have kissed me like this wasn't gonna lastKept me from sayin' something I'll never take backYou could have held me like there was no chanceOf me waking up where I amYou could have stopped short of every dream I've ever hadSo help me girl, you've gone too farIt's way too late to save my heartThe way it feels each time we touchI know I've never been so loved
I live on a chainYou, share the same last nameAs a jokeI sent a bottle of whiskeyAs you choked i knewIt made you feel dirtyI was waiting over hereFor life to beginI was looking for the new thingAnd you were the sunshineHeading my frontlineI was aloneYou were just around the corner from meTime alone is goodI spend my days in the cityDirty neighborhoodYou know you'll never convince me
I'm feeling mean todayNot lost, not blown awayJust irritated and quite hatedSelf control breaks downWhy's everything so tameI like my life insaneI'm barricating and debating whoI'm gonna kick aroundRight nowCan't find a wayTo get across the hateWhen I see youRight NowI'm feeling strange insideI want to slash and beat youRight NowI rip apart the things insideThat excite youRight NowI can't control myselfI fucking hate youI'm feeling cold todayNot hurt just fucked awayI'm devasted and frustratedGod I feel so bound
Could you move in slow motion?Everything goes by so fastJust slow down a littleSave the best part for lastYou speak in riddlesYour intentions turn me oldI'm yours foreverWill you love me when I'm gone?When I'm goneYou're an undiscovered(When I'm gone)Over walls we've trampled(When I'm gone)It's you I admire(When I'm gone)My living exampleOh, your eyes are
Stone-cutters made them from stonesChosen specially for you and IWho will live inside?The mountaineers gathered timber piled highIn which to take alongTraveling many miles knowing they'd get hereWhen they got here all exhaustedOn the roof leaks they got startedAnd now when the rain comes we can be thankfulWhen the mountaineers saw that everything fitThey were glad and so they took offThought we were due for a changeOr two around this placeWhen they got back they're all mixed upWith no one to stay with
Did you ever want to be overrun by bandits;To hand over all of your things and start over new?While we were out hunting for foodOur house was being robbedI caught an apple and she caught a foxSo I caught a rabbit but she caught an oxSo upon our return, we found everything goneWhich for us was no lossAnd we started over
No one seems to be around todayThey must've all gone off without me againI think I'll head homeMaybe I'll find them gathered 'round my doorstepOh, to sleep in a comfortable bedI think I'll head homeNo one seems to be around todayThey must've all gone off without me againI think I'll head homeI think I'll head homeBring me a day full of honest workAnd a roof that never leaksI'll be satisfied
I must be careful now in my stepsYears of calculations and the stressMy science is waiting, nearly completeOne glass will last for nearly a weekLet me not get down from walking with no-oneAnd if I stumble from exhaustion
My young bride,Why are your shoulders like thatOf a tired old woman,Like a tired old woman?My young bride,Why are your fingers like thatOf the hedge in winter,Of the hedge in winter?
I saw she was living under some branchesI saw she was happy in her circumstancesI also live under branchesI'd rather not live in these placesWe won't get married'Cause she won't have meShe wakes up awfully early these days, these days
In this camp there's one who delights meBrings me afternoon tea then she leaves meWhen they're climbing over the seaShe helps to keep our strength completeBut I'd rather stay'Cause the north is too far awayI wanted to marry BabetteAnd the weapons on my shouldersI'd throw into seaweed banksAnd the willows and the lime-treesWere gathered there for usAbove the unconquered seasUnconquered seasThere's the horn callPut your boots and courage on and run
I'm tired of being here on this hillNo one lives to be 300 yearsLike the way it used to beI think they were giantsI think they were giantsOn this hill, nothing grows except greedYou will stay to finish your workAs long as need beAs long as need be
It covers the roadwaysIt covers the hillsidesIt covers the housesIt covers the frozen pinesAnd we had the snowfallTo run all the rations dryAnd when we got hungryWe'd taken what wasn't oursAnd now we will set outThe seats are cold on this boatAs we head towards the oceanMaking our way out
Yes I'm sorry that I missed youI'm sorry that I missed youWhen there's no one there to greet youI'm sorry that I missed youYou're always chasing after deerOh my dear, oh my dearAnd through the meadow I can hearMy fears, oh my fearsFor myself I must remind
The hands of time have brought you hereTo make a change, to break down the wallsYou are the ones and you are the onlyTrying to live by your own goalsAnd you all cry for freedomRaise your fists to the sky (Fists to the sky)Let your voice speak for the revolutionAll join forces with all the powers that you feelLet your heart beat for the revolutionLed by the templars of steel
Listen, was it you who spoke the words that thingsWould happenBut not to meOh, things are gonna happen naturallyOh, I'm taking your adviceAnd I'm looking on the bright sideAnd balancing the whole damn thingOh, but often times those words get tangled up in linesAnd the bright lights turn to nightOh oh, until the dawn it bringsAnother day we'll sing about the magic that was you and me'Cause you and I both lovedWhat you and I spoke ofOthers just dream of the love that I lovedOthers only dreamed of the loveOf the love that I, I loveLove, love, hmmm'
Don't look at meEvery day is so wonderfulAnd suddenly, i saw debrisNow and then, I get insecureFrom all the pain, I'm so ashamedI am beautiful no matter what they sayWords can't bring me downI am beautiful in every single wayYes, words can't bring me downSo don't you bring me down todayTo all your friends, you're deliriousSo consumed in all your doomTrying hard to fill the emptiness
Well I swear your perfume babyIs made out of turnip greensEvery time I kiss you girlIt tastes like pork and beansEven though you're wearin' thoseUp-town high heelsI can tell from your giant stepYou been walkin' through the cotton fieldsOh! You're so down home girl.

Let's goI met her a club, her friend liked me but she didn'tShe noticed a lot of girls giving up their phone digitsShe didn't wanna be one of those hoesIn clothes exploiting her body from head to toesShe had glossy lips she was swaying her hipsOn the dance floor and every nigga's flashing her gripTrying to impress her in vain she gave no playNiggaz hit her up for numbers and she said no wayI thought to myself let it go and roll on, BBut like Smokey said she really had a hold on meI couldn't stop staring I started to fantasize with herVoices in my head said she's tantalizing yaEven if I moved to the other side of the partyI had pictures in my head of her moving that bodyI was beside myself with hunger painSo I slowly walked over and I asked her nameWhat's your name, what's your number?
And she spoke words that would melt in your handsAnd she spoke words of wisdomTo the basement peopleTo the basementMany surprises await youIn the basement peopleIn the basementYou hid there last timeYou know we're gonna find youSick in the car seat'Cause you're not up to goingOut on the main streetsCompleting your missionYou hid there last timeYou know we're gonna find youSick in the car seat'Cause you're not up to going

We both deserve each other's loveYou, you're just as sweet as peaches and cream(To me you're as sweet as peaches and cream)You must have stepped right out of my dreams'Cause you and I were meant to be('Cause you and I were meant to be)I, I am a very fortunate guy(So lucky am I to be by your side)Lucky to have you all of the timeOne of a kind, you know to me you're so fineI thank the Lord for you and I, yeah
Every night he'd come to meI'd cook for him, I'd pour his teaI was in my thirties thenHad made some money, lived with menWe'd lay us down to give and getBeneath the white mosquito netAnd since no counting had begunWe lived a thousand years in one
Smile though your heart is achingSmile even though its breakingWhen there are clouds in the sky, you'll get byIf you smile through your fear and sorrowSmile and maybe tomorrowYou'll see the sun come shining through for you
From bad luck I'm walking awayI'm not getting stuckI'm not gonna stayTo good things I'm moving aheadI'm tired of dyingI'm living insteadOnce in a while I wake upWondering why we gave upBut once in a whileComes and it fades awayThe sun's up and lighting the skyI never could see it
The summer windCame blowing inFrom across the seaIt lingered thereSo warm and fairTo walk with meAll summer longWe sang a songAnd strolled on golden sandTwo sweetheartsAnd the summer wind
Stop all this talk, turn off the telephoneOpen up another bottle, send those people homeLet it get real quiet, turn that lamp way down lowI'm gonna float down this river of tearsI remember how we spoke on the days he was dryEven now that he's gone he can make a woman cryBut he saw through me deaf dumb and blindHe knew his way down this river of tears"Dashed hopes and best intentions" people say
Would'nt you love to be out on the rollin' seaWith only the sky above you for a roofWhat if all your friends were thereLaugh at all your jokes and shareSweet salt air with you

At forest edge, I swore I sawA lovely young girlFrom afar(Did she smile?)Yes, she seemed to smile right at me so I stepped in(Was it dark?)Yes, the light was leaving, wind came moving all the leaves, ohWhere did she go?Long branches wept
I'm walking unknown territoryWhere the sun's not shiningThere's nothing golden about Golden LaneThe smoke is heavy in my lungs and the adverts are workingI just can't sell for who or what I amI don't wanna miss out on anythingAt the same time I feel the need to retreatEverything is temporary these daysMight as well go out for a third night in a rowShould I give my money to a good causeOr save for a holidayIn a couple of months I could be in paradiseBut the girl at the bar is well nice and she's looking over

When I grow upI want to be a foresterRun through the moss on high heelsThat's what I'll doThrowing out a boomerangWaiting for it to come back to meWhen I grow upI want to live near the seaCrab claws and bottles of rumThat's what I'll haveStaring at a seashell
I've got a friend who I've known since I was sevenWe used to talk on the phone, if we had time, if it's the right timeAccompany me by the kitchen sinkWe talk about love, we talk about dishwasher tablets, illnessAnd we dream about heavenI know it, I think I know it from a hymn

So I lost my head a while agoBut you seem to done no betterWe set fire in the snowIt ain't overI'm not doneSome do magicAnd some do harmI'm holding onHolding onI'm holding on to a straw
All dressed up with somewhere to goGot ten new messages on your phoneKeep trying to stop the night from falling to piecesThe night goes on and on and on and onWhere're you going and where's Steve goneThis whole night is just falling to pieces
Don't talk rubbish to meI use reason on my brainIt's those little superstitionsThat get me through the stress and strainI have made my contributionsAnd now and then i findOn the subject of my love lifeI've been left behindLet's make the most of itThe time we've got togetherQuit all the secrets that areChoking up your heartAnd tearing all the light from the starsLet's make the most of itThe time we've got togetherQuit all the secrets that areChoking up your heartAnd tearing all the light from the starsI'm made some calculationsBut will not put them to the testIt's those little superstitionsThat cannot be laid to rest
Oh God I'm running late againI don't believe thisAnother Wednesday morning on the train to workAnd my weekend spread into the middle of the weekI'm boozing every night, 3 hours sleepCheck all the people then stare at my feetGuy next to me pretend to read the MetroSort of bloke who calls everybody broBut only met a black guy at Uni thoughAnd the lady with the kid watches the guard meet the trainSuspicous EyesLooking for the endSuspicous EyesLooking for the end

If all that grows starts to fade, starts to falterOh, let me inside, let me inside, not to waitLet all that run through the fields through the quiet,Go on with their, own with their own hidden waysWhen all newness of gold travels far fromWhere it had once been,
Talkin' sweet kinda liesDon't you believe in himIf you do, he'll make you cryHe'll send you flowersAnd paint the town with another girlHe's a sweet talkin' guyBut he's my kind of guySweeter than sugarKisses like wineDon't let him under your skin'Cause you'll never win

There's just now way to say how much I love youYou never made me cry and that's just fineOnly got my fear to put above youYou know we all get scared from time to timeLove me with your head and heartLove me from the place it startsLove me from your head and heart
You don't know what love isUntil you've learned the meaning of the bluesUntil you've loved a love you had to loseYou don't know what love isYou don't know how lips hurtUntil you've kissed and had to pay the costUntil you've flipped your heart and you have lost
It bleeds!It breathes!What stands before us, is not a machineIt breathes, it will bleed and it will dream!Its body is covered in hundreds of wiresAnd a mouth that attempts to speakIt attempts to lieOnly murmursCollapse from its jawsAnd a world, a world withoutA world without you
I got your emailsYou just don't get femalesNow do you?What's in my heartIs not in your head anywayMate, you're too lateAnd your weren't worth the waitNow were you?It's out of my handsSince you blew your last chanceWhen you played meYou'll have to cry me outYou'll have to cry me outThe tears that'll fallMean nothing at allIt's time to get over yourselfBaby, you ain't all thatMaybe there's no way backYou can keep talkingBut baby, I'm walking awayWhen I found outHow you messed me aboutI was broken (heartbroken)
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up, turn it upBaby, it's over, we both know, let's go forwardI love you, but in a different way, I love you, foreverNow that we've come to the end of our storyAnd I know that it's gonna be hard for meMight hurt some, might get too much, but I gotta let it beAs the world turns around and we go different placesNew things, new dreams, new facesWhat a shake up, when we break up, but we keep our memories'Cause I know you can't stay,So I won't be waiting, anticipating for the fall (Won't be waiting, anticipating)We had our time, babySo I won't be waiting, anticipating for the call (Won't be waiting, anticipating)Turn it up, turn it up for the people that say"We're moving on and we'll be okay"Turn it up, turn it up for the people that say"We're moving on and we'll be okay"Maybe it's better, and I want you to be happy
Falling inSix hours from morningAnd falling inSink me off to sleepSo come along withinI think it's time to let me inI'm tipping my footVery close to the edgeAnd just a few more of your secondsAnd I need for me to repairTo neatly stand and spinIt around in my headOh, can I please have some silence?Oh, can I please have some silence?
Everyday is the same.Nothing changes.Just the names and faces,And, situations.Who made up the rules,That we follow?Who's the chosen fool,And the fallen?I'm betting my life,That it all rewinds, and erases.Do I have the right,To receive God, eternal graces?I know, I may sound disturbed,I know...But I have this feeling that,None of this matters.I know, I may sound disturbed,I know...
Kissing your skinYour skeleton splinters my daydreamsUnder this other street everything singsShadows slide across the wallI walk outside and I try to see youRight in front of meA silhouette is something sweetIt's so bright
Please don't stop meBut go and leave meYou can't keep me insidePlease don't stop meFrom being so strangeYou can't help meWith your liesWatch me self-destructPlease don't stop meLet me loose in the blackYou can't touch me
Yeah, yeahWhat you got if you ain't got loveThe kind that you just want to give awayIt's okay to open upGo ahead and let the light shine throughI know it's hard on a rainy dayYou wanna shut the world out and just be left aloneBut don't run out on your faith'Cause sometimes that mountain you've been climbingIs just a grain of sandAnd what you've been out there searching for foreverIs in your handsAnd when you figure out love is all that matters after all
It was two weeks after the day she turned eighteenAll dressed in whiteGoing to the church that nightShe had his box of letters in the passenger seatSixpence in a shoe, something borrowed, something blueAnd when the church doors opened up wideShe put her veil downTrying to hide the tearsOh, she just couldn't believe itShe heard the trumpets from the military bandAnd the flowers fell out of her handsBaby why'd you leave meWhy'd you have to go?I was counting on forever, now I'll never knowI can't even breatheIt's like I'm looking from a distanceStanding in the background
Suppose I called you up tonightAnd told you that I love youAnd suppose I said I wanna come back homeAnd suppose I cried and said I think I've finally learned my lessonAnd I'm tired of spending all my time aloneIf I told you that I realized you're all I ever wantedAnd it's killing me to be so far awayWould you tell me that you love me tooAnd would we cry together?Or would you simply laugh at me and say...I told you soOh, I told you soI told you some day you'd come crawling back
People smile and tell meI'm the lucky oneAnd we've just begunThink I'm gonna have a sonHe will be like she and meAs free as a doveConceived in loveSun is gonna shine aboveEven though we ain't got moneyI'm so in love with you, honeyAnd everything will bringA chain of love, oh, oh, yeahIn the mornin', when I riseYou bring a tear of joy to my eyesAnd tell me everything is gonna be alrightSeems as though, a month agoI was Beta-ChiNever got highOh, was a sorry guy
Now, while we're here aloneAnd all is said and doneNow I can let you knowBecause of all you've shownI've grown enough to tell youYou'll always be inside of meHow many roads have gone by?So many words left unspokenI needed to be by your sideIf only to hold you
Are those your eyes?Is that your smile?I've been lookin' at you foreverYet I never saw you beforeAre these your handsHoldin' mine?Now I wonder howI could've been so blindFor the first timeI am looking in your eyesFor the first timeI'm seein' who you areI can't believe how much I seeWhen you're lookin' back at me
...This path leads into dark...In shrouding veil of thickening dusk,In the caress of darkening woodsThere winds my path, narrow and fadingLet this twilight linger upon meMoon and stars take over when sun has fled
There are nine million bicycles in BeijingThat's a factIt's a thing we can't denyLike the fact that I will love you till I dieWe are twelve billion light years from the edgeThat's a guessNo-one can ever say it's trueBut I know that I will always be with you
You are the tiger burning brightDeep in the forest of my nightYou are the one who keeps me strong in this worldYou sleep by the silent cooling streamsDown in the darkness of my dreamsAll of my life I never knew
When you walked into my worldI was someone else's girlEvery time you look in my eyesAll that I felt somehow diesNo no no noCan't you see what you're doing to meNo no no no
Found but in the groundBig top and through headTo that cloud it turned turned turned aroundVery highThrough birds and variatsTell me howTo stay in thatRight and dryI fear to lose herOut of sight[Chorus]
Radio chatterIt's back, maybe the instruments failed and maybe they didn't, there's only one way to find outSorryIt wasn't your fault, Ellen . . . but make sure you get the reports to Washington before morning
What would I have to doTo get you to notice me tooDo I stand in lineOne of a million admiring eyesWalk a tightrope way up highWrite your name across the skyI'm going crazy just to let you knowYou'd be amazed how much I love you so, babyWhen I get my hands on you I won't let goThis time I know it's for realShould I write or call your home
I stood on faith and the corner of ambitionI came here to sink or swimAnd to show them all that they were wrongAnd though I never thought I'd make it this farSo the curtains are downFor the moment I'm someoneThere were those in the wings who waited, who came this wayNow there gone
I don't pick up the mailI don't pick up the phoneI don't answer the doorI'd just soon be aloneI don't keep this place upI just keep the lights downI don't live in these roomsI just rattled aroundI'm just a ghost in this houseI'm just a shadow upon these wallsAs quietly as a mouseI haunt these halls
In the spring of 1856, with the snow still on the ground,Two little boys were lost in the mountains above the town.The father went out hunting; the boys had stayed behind.While mother tended to her chores, they wandered from her side.The two had gone to follow him and lost their way instead.By dusk the boys had not been found and fear had turned to dread.Two hundred men had gathered there to comb the mountainside.The fires were built on the highest peak in hopes they'd see the light.Oh mommy and daddy, why can't you hear our cries?The day is almost over - soon it will be night.We're so cold and hungry and our feet are tired and sore
Baby mine, don't you cryBaby mine, dry your eyesRest your head close to my heartNever to part, baby of mineLittle one, when you playDon't you mind what they sayLet those eyes sparkle and shineNever a tear, baby of mine
When I recall his parting wordsMust I accept his fateOr take myself far from this placeI thought I heard a black bell tollA little bird did singMan has no choiceWhen he wants every thingWe'll rise above the scarlet tide
It's amazing how you can speak right to my heartWithout sayin' a word, you can light up the darkTry as I may I could never explainWhat I hear when you don't say a thingThe smile on your face lets me know that you need meThere's a truth in your eyes sayin' you'll never leave meThe touch of our hands says you'll catch me if ever I fall
"Could IBreak throughThe wall you put me in,Can I,Be sure,You even keep me here,Blood onMy fingers,Seems to testifyTo myImprisonment,But I have my doubts.I fadeThe soundAway...
As long as I rememberWe've marched across this landOh, oh, oh...Reached for a new horizonPulled by the killing handOh, oh, oh...All fed up with liesThe Time has comeTo Break these chains and flyHere we stand, bound forever moreWe're out of this world, until the endHere we are, mighty, gloriousAt The End Of The RainbowWith gold in our hands
Tiny heart, stuck inside yourselfWhen will you open up for me?I love you soI wanna meet you againBefore one of us must goYour lips touch every hand but mineIf you choose me, I'm waiting for youIf you choose me, I'm waiting for youAlways waitingTiny heart, you're not by yourself
Somewhere, over the rainbowBluebirds flyThey flyin' highOver that old rainbowI wonder, why Lord, can I?Somewhere over the rainbowWay up highYou know there's a land old Jerry dreamed ofOnes in a lullaby
The single girl, all alone in a great big townThe single girl, gets so tired of love lettin' her downThe life's unreal and the people are phonyAnd the nights can get so lonelyThe single girl needs a sweet lovin' man to lean onI'm a single girl wonderin' if love could be passin' me by
I sign in my nameI guess I have to wait a whileI'm gonna play this gameCall me up if you know how to dialYou always had my numberYou need to be my loverHumiliationI'm in the waiting roomIf we both want the loveAnd I wait long enoughThen the ground that we're on might be commonAll I can do is wait for youAll I can do is wait for you
When this old world starts a getting me down*And people are just too much for me to face.I'll climb way up to the top of the stairs and all my cares just drift right into space.On the roof, it's peaceful as can be and there the world below don't bother me, no, no.So when I come home feeling tired and beat, I'll go up where the air is fresh and sweet.
PainBuried so far awayInto my life of nothingSick of the same old thingSo I dig a hole and bury painSick of the same old thingSo I dig a hole and bury painI am so high alwaysBurying my life so slowlySick of the same old thing!So I dig a hole and bury pain!Sick of the same old thing!So I dig a hole and bury pain!Sick of the same old thing!So I dig a hole and bury pain!Sick of the same old thing!So I dig a hole and bury pain!

The time has come to realize,What you are, what you've done inside.The time has come,All have something to talk about, I will too.Looking back,And now I realize,How much you really liked him,This child's mind you terrorized.You came to him,He really didn't know your lies.Now his innocence's gone,He's that child you terrorized.This fucking thing that I feel,It came to me from you.This fucking thing that I,Because of you.My childhood is gone,Because I loved you.My childhood is gone,Because I loved you.Be my neighbor!Looking back,And now I realize,How much you really loved him,
I met a friend of spiritHe drank and womanizedAnd I sat before his sanityI was holding back from cryingHe saw my complicationsAnd he mirrored me back simplifiedAnd we laughed how our perfectionWould always be denied"Heart and humor and humility"He said "Will lighten up your heavy load"I left him for the refuge of the roadsI fell in with some driftersCast upon a beachtownWinn Dixie cold cuts and highway hand me downsAnd I wound up fixing dinnerFor them and Boston JimI well up with affectionThinking back down the roads to then
Somebody loves you, girlThis I swear is true, girlSo you think no one cares, oh, boyWhat a down thing to think ofAnd if you give me a chance(If you give me a chance)I will give you true loveAnd every day, I watch youI just can't do without youYou're so doggone prettyI got to have you and I've gotta saySomebody loves you, girlThis I swear is true, girlSomebody loves you, girlThis I swear is true, girl
Movin' in soundHummin' to the musicTrying to move onI'm walking in rhythmSingin' my songThinkin' about my babyTryin' to get homeMovin' in soundHummin' to the music

Everyone dated the demise of our neighborhood from the suicides of the Lisbon girls.People saw their clairvoyance in the wiped-out elms and harsh sunlight.Some thought the torture tearing the Lisbon girls pointed to a simple refusal to accept the world as it was handed down to them:So full of flaws.But the only thing we are certain of after all these years is the insufficiency of explenation."Obviously doctor, you've never been a thirteen year-old girl."The Lisbon girls were 13, Cecillia, 14, Lux, 15, Bonnie, 16, Mary, and 17, Therese.No one could understand how Mrs. Lisbon and Mr. Lisbon, our math teacher, had produced such beautiful creatures.From that time on, the Lisbon house began to change.Almost every day, and even when she wasn't keeping an eye on Cecilia,Lux would suntan on her towel wearing a swimsuit that caused the knife-sharpener to give her a 15-minute demonstration for free.

Who hears the voices calling - who calls to rise above them?Who rises when they've fallen, taking an oath for the trouble they're causing.Who reaches out for knowing, who knows when they've been chosen?
Poor boy he knows he's alive, he's afraid to learn,He don't want to get where he's going cos he thinks he's gonna burn,He can't handle being born in the middle of a big black line,No matter where he looks, to him it's just either side.
Angel cried last night; it was something in her dreams,Carving pictures on her bedroom wall, she wonders what it means,But gets by inside by saying it's not real,

Cautiously take cover in the woodland - no mistakes at all.Some terrain will catch you at your weakest - careful not to fall.Stay by the fire, sip from your water, lie in position, the winds blowing colder.

The candles have been blown out by the windDon't be scared, my love, I'm right by your sideI still remember the times I walked alone... deadUntil you woke me up and made me come aliveWith her love she feeds the fire in my heartAnd in her eyes, oh the birth of starsThe sun won't shine on me without your love
Born under the moon of the elven goddess of battle.Raised by the elves, the mighty dwellers of the woods.Fire in the heart of this divine son.Battle, his destiny's to fight the evil.Many shall be thy enemy,And great is the danger that'll seek you.Signs of your birth made you to be the one,So carry your sword with honour.For many years he fought, many years he spent in battle.Soon was to be known the divine strength of this elven youngster.
Carpe diem...Seize the day before your life fades away.Reach for the skies - for the distant sunAnd keep on hiding from the gun.No! You need to sell your soulFor it's great to lose control.Can't you feel that growing desireTo go down with the blazing fire?You need to burn and reach to the point of no return.- Waste no time dreaming in vain!You and I aren't built to last
Again the sky has fallen down on meOnce more a world has crumbled down and over meAnd yet in some twisted wayI enjoy my miseryAnd in some strange wayI have grown together with my agonyI feel home in despair for I dwell in griefAnd I feel home when the air's too thick to breathe
I have come a long way where I started fromBut I'm still not even close to where I'm going(And now) I can no longer see the shineThat has been lighting up my wayI cannot feel its glowingThe fire in my heart is dyingAnd the zeal I had is goneThis path that I've chosen's a rocky oneLong, hard and frozen it has become
PHENIX(Music: Tenkula & SENTENCED, defiance: Teiwaz)Burned alive in the flames of love- The ashes scattered in the windFucked up by the unholy trinity;You, me and our "perfect law"(Our perfect love)Each time I walk under a moonlit sky- Each time I dream of you"Death won't tear us' part but lack of love"Kill all gods and all mother-lovin' whores- My heart is build for War
Think about all the good in your life- It's only temporaryThink about all the positive sides in life- They never last foreverSo drink to forgetAnd drown all your sorrowBury your dreamsChoose mind refineryAll the tears and the fears and the lies and the cries and the...(Nepenthe)
Think of your lifetime as one dayIt's fading awayThe shadows are growing longThink of existence as a flame and death as rainStorm clouds - they ride alongAt life's eve our flames will ceaseEternally, unavoidablyEventually all paths will leadTo the cemetery
I am stunned, you caught me by surpriseAssault and run - you outdid yourselves!Beaten numb, I didn't see you sneaking 'round the cornerHow could I... There is no sight in my third eyeWe're not done, I will hunt you downOne by one... I'll blow you all to hell!For you faceless, nameless cowards cannot hideThe day of reckoning will arriveStrike from behind and knock me to the groundKick me while I'm down!Stab me in the back, you bastardsTear my heart out of my chest!
Approaching the moment nowLong hard journey in its endStarting to loom right now,The final round and then it hits youIt kicks you, it slicks you in hellAll the toil and all exhaustionAll those times we hatedAll the losses, sacrificesAll those things were missedAll the suffering and distortionShit we toleratedAll that we abandonedAll for this
Melodic stanzasAre symphonizing their wayThrough your weary headTo feed your distrustAnd fill it's mouth with the desireTo soulfully be one with your creationNot a subject to controlYou call upon a higer powerFor help and inspirationThe crowd waitsAnd turns their faces
This dole crowner gallows meAs this mere welkin hallowed beWhereupon i trick and train and tireTo limn my umbered love in fireBefore this noble mare bewraysAs i clearly see it all decaysIn debile coil of smoke suspires
All we know, now has come undoneBalance lost between the moon and sunHear our prayer, keeper of the sky divineUpon us all, let your wisdom shineLosing faith as the madness prevailsIn us all we are searching for a reasonA need to calm the stormIn our sails let your winds be strongBreathe the air around youThe oceans fill your veins and winds embrace your heartFeel the change within you
On the edge of paradiseTears of woe fall, cold as iceHear my cryRenounce, have you, thy nameEternal is my painEternal is the pain that leads meTo the thrones of temptationEternal is the pain that leads meTo the thrones of temptationEternal is the pain that leads meTo the thrones of temptationThere was a timeWhen nine choirs sang theEndless melody of lightMusic of the spheresThere was a placeWhere mortals embraced thunder and majestyTheir fate lay in our handsFeel my wings slowly fadingForever lost in time, I cryThe burning conflict I'm feelingIt summons me to descend into the other sideAnd just beyond the stars blazing
Decoctions of JimsonweedSlimy trailing plants distilClaustrophobia and blood mixed seedCursed downstairs against my willCobweb sticks to molten yearsCockroaches served with creamI wipe the silver bullet tearsAnd with every tear a dreamWith every tear a dream...
A new serum eradicates the illnessAn old man rises from his wheelchairWhen suffering unknown attacks the painlessAnd common animals are becoming rareAs water spins in circles twice
On a cold and misty nightA ring of torches light the hallowed groundWhere his father's laid to restIn the reflection of a swordHe sees his destiny and he swears up to the skyYou will not have died in vainOn the field with sword and shieldAmidst the din of dying man's wailsWar is waged, and the battle will rageUntil only the righteous prevail
I was your fear and you were my fateI wanted you near but I bred your hateYou left me for dead, deep down in the mudWith scars on my head, in my heart and my bloodOn my head, in my heart and my bloodOn my head, in my heart and my blood"A caress of starsA silhouette in the twilight skyThe daybreak sets on silver seasMy name echoes through crimson hills
Erase the pictures from my mindEliminate the presence of your kindUnloose the strings of instinct lawsJust to fall into some other jawsIn pounding afternoon i riseFor the pleasure of dying twiceA wingcut angel in decline
We drank as much as we couldAnd she drank more than she shouldWe stumbled out of this cheap whisky barAnd that is the story so farGuieded by the dim streetlightsWe walked through the black harbour nightNo people, no passing carWell, that is the story so far"She thinks she smells the northland snowNorthland snow
You dance like liquid fireLike crystal methedrineYou make the stars come closerThe most beautiful girl I've seenYou're everything I wantOnly you can set me freeYou're an angel in the snowYou're a shot in the arm for meI will let your L.E.D.'s shineI will let your L.E.D.'s shineI will let your L.E.D.'s shineAs long as you are mineI will let your L.E.D.'s shineAs long as you are mine
Here comes the sidewalk boss againTelling me how I can't cave inThat I'm a study in blackNeed a pat on the backI look up and smileA picture of dissatisfactionThat he can only see as a junkieThough I might be straight as an arrowHe's busy shaking hands with my monkeyBusy shaking hands with my monkeyWell, I go in the carStraight to the barWhere my sweetie pours the beerFor the millions of fans ignoring the bandsHe's in my earWants me to live in denial
Wiped out and the city's litAnother sick rock and rollerActing like a dickNeeding cashRooting through the trashThat piles up in this placeAnd fills up behind my empty faceFull of things we are not to doYou come over with all of your friendsAnd all their opinions I don't want to knowAnd I'm looking over my shoulderBooking away with nowhere to goI run down to the corner lotIt's forty-five past twoI almost forgot to show
It's to reveal that fucked up copAmped up on prescription pillsThat brought my heart to a stopAnd i want to tell you there's a riot comingLike a drug in the waterA punch in the stomach makes sons into daughtersI met a girl on the squareWho showed me how to kill my cares
Here come your pride and joyThe comic little drunkYou call your boyMaking everybody smileWho takes your pretty planAnd then becomes a disappearing manAfter a little whileI saw you with your make-up running downNow what's that all aboutYou say you don't want anyone aroundCause you're all cleaned out
I'm a first timer, wishing i was someone elseWhen i see you by yourselfIn a corridor where you find yourself now blockedBy a door you lockedYou won't do what the doctor ordered
Georgia georgiaIt's been many milesSince i've seen your foggy smileClose up and personalYour arsenal of excusesYou never told herWhen you walked out on the savannah shoulderWith your veins all full of beerThinking well at least now everything is clearBut oh manWhat plan
Pick me up in an hour or soI don't really recommend it, noThey'll probably just put you downI believe youI wanna be youI believe youI wanna be youI know you're not through with it yetIt's a big decisionYou can't kick when you're downGot a feeling kind of like a coughAin't nothing gonna shake it offAin't nothing gonna shake it offUntil you talk out loud
No bad dream fucker's gonna boss me aroundChristian brothers gonna take him downIt can't help me get overDon't be cross, this sick I wantI've seen the boss blink on and off
They're waking you up to close the barThe street's wet you can tell by the sound of the carsThe bartender's singing ClementineWhile he's turning around the open signDreadful sorry ClementineThough you're still her man
Killing a southern belle is all you know how to doThat and give other people hellIt's what they expect from you tooBut I wouldn't have you how you areI don't wanna walk aroundI don't even wanna breatheI live in a southern town
Here in line where stupid shit collidesWith dying shooting starsAll we got to show what we really areIs the same kind of scarsAnd looking at you, all I see isYou're waiting for somethingSingle fileYou're a murder mileYou idiot kid
Alphabet city is hauntedConstantina feels right at homeShe probably won't say you're wrongBut you're already wrongYou're already wrongAnd you threw up whatever she shot downSaid show me around this alphabet townSaid show me aroundThere's a name you keep repeating
Everything is exactly rightWhen I walk around here drunk every nightWith an open container from 7-11In St. Ides heavenI've been out haunting the neighborhoodAnd everybody can see I'm no goodWhen I'm walking out between parked carsWith my head full of stars
A low riding junkie girlRode down south to your little world, like a dreamYou can do it if you want toYou can do it if you want toYou can do it if you want to be like meI wouldn't be a hero, if I wasn't such a zero, if I wasn't such a zeroGood to goAll I ever see around here is things of her's that you left lying around
He's pleased to meet you underneath the hearseIn the cathedral with the glass stained blackSinging sweet high notes that echo backTo destroy their masterMay be a long time til you get the call-upBut it's sure as fate and hard as your luckNo one'll know where you are
You walk down AlamedaShuffling your deck of trick cards over everyoneLike some precious only sonFace down, bow to the championYou walk down AlamedaLooking at the cracks in the sidewalkThinking about your friendsHow you maintain all them inA constant state of suspenseFor your own protection over their affection
Throwing candy out to the crowdDragging down the mainThe helpless little thing with the dirty mouthWho's always got something to sayYou're sitting around at home now waiting for your brother to callI saw him down in the alleyHaving had enough of it all
Got bitten fingernails and a head full of the pastAnd everybody's gone at lastA sweet sweet smile that's fading fast'Cause everybody's gone at lastDon't get upset about itNo not anymore
They asked me to come down and watch the paradeTo march down the street like the Duracell bunnyBut we get away from the cavalcadeThrowing out candy that looks like moneyTo people passing byThey'd all seem to be going the other waySaid, "Won't you follow me down to the Rose Parade?"Tripped over a dog in a choke-chain collar
I'm going out sleepwalkingWhere mute memories start talkingThe boss that couldn't help but hurt youAnd the pretty thing he made desert youI'm going out like a babyA naïve unsatisfiable babyGrabbing onto whatever's aroundFor the soaring high or the crushing downWith hidden cracks that don't show
I'm in love with the worldThrough the eyes of a girlWho's still around the morning afterWe broke up a month agoAnd I grew up, I didn't knowI'd be around the morning afterIt's always been, wait and seeA happy day and then you payAnd feel like shit the morning after
I'm waiting for the trainThe subway that only goes one wayThe stupid thing that will come to pull us apartAnd make everybody lateYou spent everything you had
Last call, he was sick of it allAsleep at homeTold you off and goodbyeWell you know one day it'll come to haunt youThat you didn't tell him quite the truthYou're a crisis, you're an icicleYou're a tongueless talkerYou don't care what you sayYou're a jaywalker and you just, just walk awayAnd that's all you doThe clap of the fading out sound of your shoesMade him wonder who he thought that he knewLast call, he was sick of it allThe endless stream of reminders
I'm writing you for the hundredth time cuz ninety nine I threw awayAnd in my mind a thousand times I've said everything I wanna sayI've said everything I wanna sayBut you find a way to keep me hanging onYou find a way to make everything go wrongIt's the way you lose meSay you choose meThen pass me by like you never knew meYou find a way to lead me onI change my mind a thousand times but circumstances stay the sameI told you no an hour ago
Forget About YouIt's been one year to the daySince I watched you drive away with only street lights glowingHere we are now face to face fumbling all the words to sayHiding feelings that I don't want showing nowI am useless young and stupid for thinking I'll get over youI'll make excuses but the truth isIt's the best that I can doI can't forget about you
Looks like history's repeatingI don't learn from my mistakesI can't feel the water risingA wave will always breakI want to take you backBack to where we started before the lights had changedWords we didn't get to say seem to hit the hardestNow just your memory is all that ever coming back to me
A last minute decisionLay it all on the lineGlasspipe recollections of antichristThe nominees all on fireCash money upfrontWe're all part of the scamDead stars at the end of the ropeA fake miracle to beholdLife is brightIt'll take out your eyesBurn these liesCut away the ties
(Dolving talks)"Come a little bit closer.So I can see what you taste like.A pale face. A vision of suicide.Dead ends and a St.Jude figurine.Bury me in a shallow grave.So the dogs can dig me out.If I die tonight, well that suits me fine.'Cause I'd be better off covered in lye."(Chorus:)This one is abysmal.This is a oneway ticket down.
Play that stupid piece of shit!Oah!Aah!Hey! You mo'!I've Got A FeelingWith The Wrong PeopleAnd I Can't Control My ThoughtsI Wish That I Could SleepAnd Just Get This Over WithThis is only high school bullshitI Was WarnedAbsolutely numbNo Good Around PeopleEveryone Knows And Watches Me
Oh the night... here it comes againIt's on with the jeans, the jacket and the shirtHow'd I end up feeling so badFor such a little girlAnd I hold you close in the back of my mindFeels so good but damn it makes me hurtAnd I'm too scared to know how I feel about you now
My Love is on the line, my love is on the lineMy Love is on the line, my love is on the lineMy Love is on the line, my love is on the lineA little late for all the things you didn't sayI'm not sad for youBut I'm sad for all the time I had to waste'Cause I learned the truthYour heart is in a place I no longer want to beI knew there'd come a day I'd set you free 'causeI'm sick and tired of always being sick and tiredYour love isn't fairYou live in a world where you didn't listenAnd you didn't care
Sentimental days in a misty clouded hazeOf a memory that now feels untrueI used to feel disguised, now I leave the mask behindPainting pictures that aren't so blueThe pages I've turned are the lessons I learnedSomebody bring up the lights, I want you to see(Don't you feel sorry for me)My life turned around, but I'm still living my dreams(Yes, it's true that I've been)Through it allI've hit about a million wallsWelcome to my truth, I still loveWelcome to my truth, I still loveTangled in a web with a pain hard to forget
The world is changingAnd time is spinning fastIt's so amazing how you came into my life.I know it seems all hope is goneI know you feel you can't be strongAnd once again the story ends with you and I.And anytime you feel like you just can't go onJust hold on to my loveAnd you'll never be alone.Hold onWe can make it through the fireAnd my loveI'm forever by your sideAnd you knowIf you should ever call my nameI'll be right thereYou'll never be alone.Hopeless to describeThe way I feel for youNo matter how I tryWords would never do.
I try to fly away but it's impossibleAnd every breath I take gives birth to deeper sighsAnd for a moment I am weakSo it's hard for me to speakEven though we're underneath the same blue skyIf I could paint a picture of this melodyIt would be a violin without its stringsAnd the canvas in my mindSings the songs I left behindLike pretty flowers and a sunsetIt's heavy on my heartI can't make it alone
Why'd you lie to meYou can't be trusted good for nothin' type of brotherEverything you claim to be was a lie... lieWhy'd you lie to meYou'd been creeping, sneaking, sleeping with anotherMessed up it's time to leave so bye... byeYou used to treat me like a queenSaid I was your everythingPromised me that you would never cheat on meBut I found a number on the floorAnd I won't take it no moreMade me feel so crazyThinking you'd be true to me yeah(Tell me baby) Did you really think that(I would maybe) I turn the other cheek and(Let you play me) I thought you were different,But you're like the restIt's true!Why'd you lie to meYou can't be trusted good for nothin' type of brotherEverything you claim to be was a lie... lieWhy'd you lie to meYou'd been creeping, sneaking, sleeping with another
A precious childWith an innocent mindBorn to suffer in this life or for anotherSo hopeless and relentlessFalls this remorseless dayThe dark remainsOf a violent worldThe day you diedMy tears ran dryI feel youI hear youEcho in my soulI failed youI miss you so
On the fields of desolationWe are all aloneCrying in each other's armsIn fear of the unknownFeelings of uncertaintyWe are all doomedTo live in solitudeAnd never ending gloomOn the fields of desolationEternal life or terminationWhy won't you cover me?I need your sanctuaryThis sea I'm drowning inMight be where end begins
Is it a sin, to love again?I cannot win, this pain's not fairAnd yes I climbed the highest mountainAnd yes I painted you a pretty skyNow you say it's overForgot to tell you I am sorryNever had the time to lieNow its like a sad old storyWhy do lovers always cryI never had the time to worryI never had the time to tryNow you say it's overIs it a sin, to love again?
Though you and I would dance and laugh and playWalk in the light of dayAnd talk the night awayCould you see, baby you understood thenThat I loved you, how I loved you...I couldn't chance to break the spell we hadThe happy times we hadAnd yet the times were sadJust for me, baby you understood thenI was afraid to try to call you mine...But now you've come to me(I'll call you mine)
Hello?Is there anybody in there?Just nod if you can hear meIs there anyone home?Come on nowI hear you're feeling downWell, I can ease your painAnd get you on your feet againRelaxI'll need some information firstJust the basic factsCan you show me where it hurts?There is no pain, you are recedingA distant ship, smoke on the horizon
MoneyGet awayYou get a good job with good pay and you're okayMoneyIt's a gasGrab that cash with both hands and make a stashNew car, caviar, four star daydreamThink I'll buy me a football teamMoneyWell, get backI'm all right Jack
