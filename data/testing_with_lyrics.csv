And I will not let you win

I'm totally lost with out Your light
I'm finding my self striving hard all the time

I'm out to fight the devil but never fought myself
Read a thousand books but never read myself
My soul's starving it needs to be fed lord I need your help
Hell with the devil my biggest enemy's myself
It makes me wonder am I doing this for the right reasons
I mean the money the fame and game all sounds appealing
Instead of entertaining I prefer to enlighten
But then again who am I to be in a position
To represent a whole generation of kids and to make them believe
When till this day I still struggle to uphold my deen
I read a 100 God is great in less then a minute
And though my tongue is fast like twista
My hearts not in it

Mmm any given time He'll be there
I don't really have to say no more

Oh any given time I see

Further west it's been gentrified
They turned biker bars into flower shops

Who rarely did a body harm

We'd steal the milk bottles, sneaking through the back round Jimmy's way.
What we loved most of all, was sitting round the shop, while this poor boy was sitting all alone,
Sitting all alone

Pondering times of sanctuary
He was sitting taking his piano lessons, we were on half an E
Invested life in medicine, which isn't the wisest way to go, had so much shit going on.
Convinced he'd never win. Convinced he was a sin.

Nearly as beautiful as I believe

In my head
Your voice
You've got all that I need
And this make believe will get me through
Another lonely night

Under the weight of your wings
Should ever we meet on your side of your stereo
I will pretend I know not of your thoughts
And even the way that they mirror my own
I'll take you away in the way that you take me and go where I go

In my head
Your voice
You've got all that I need
And this make believe will get me through

And you're drinking them down with cheap alcohol
And I'd be inclined to be yours for the taking
And part of this terrible mess that you're making

Living in a box under the stairs in the corner of the basement of the house
Half a block down the street from Jerry's Bait shop
You know the place
Well, anyway, back then life was going swell and everything was just peachy!

Except, of course, for the undeniable fact that every single morning
My mother would make me a big ol' bowl of sauerkraut for breakfast

Awww, big bowl of sauerkraut!
Every single mornin'!
It was driving me crazy

I said to my mom
I said, ""Hey, mom, what's up with all the sauerkraut?""
And my dear, sweet mother
She just looked at me like a cow looks at an oncoming train
And she leaned right down next to me
And she said, ""It's good for you!""
And then she tied me to the wall and stuck a funnel in my mouth
And force fed me nothing but sauerkraut until I was twenty six and a half years old

That's when I swore that someday
Someday I would get outta that basement and travel to a magical, far away place
Where the sun is always shining and the air smells like warm root beer
And the towels are oh so fluffy
Where the shriners and the lepers play their ukuleles all day long
And anyone on the street will gladly shave your back for a nickel

Wacka wacka doodoo yeah!

Well, let me tell you, people, it wasn't long at all before my dream came true
Because the very next day, a local radio station had this contest
To see who could correctly guess the number of molecules in Leonard Nimoy's butt
I was off by three, but I still won the grand prize
That's right, a first class one-way ticket to

Albuquerque
Albuquerque

Oh yeah
You know, I'd never been on a real airplane before
And I gotta tell ya, it was really great
Except that I had to sit between two large Albanian women with excruciatingly severe body odor
And the little kid in back of me kept throwin' up the whole time
The flight attendants ran out of Dr. Pepper and salted peanuts
And the in-flight movie was with Pauly Shore
And, oh yeah, three of the airplane engines burned out
And we went into a tailspin and crashed into a hillside
And the plane exploded in a giant fireball and everybody died
Except for me
You know why?

'Cause I had my tray table up
And my seat back in the full upright position
Had my tray table up
And my seat back in the full upright position
Had my tray table up
And my seat back in the full upright position

Ah ha ha ha
Ah ha ha
Ahhhh

So I crawled from the twisted, burnin' wreckage
I crawled on my hands and knees for three full days
Draggin' along my big leather suitcase and my garment bag
And my tenor saxophone and my twelve-pound bowling ball
And my lucky, lucky autographed glow-in-the-dark snorkel
But finally I arrived at the world famous Albuquerque Holiday Inn
Where the towels are oh so fluffy
And you can eat your soup right out of the ashtrays if you wanna
It's okay, they're clean!

Well, I checked into my room and I turned down the A/C
And I turned on the SpectraVision
And I'm just about to eat that little chocolate mint on my pillow
That I love so very, very much when suddenly, there's a knock on the door

Well now, who could that be?
I say, ""Who is it?""
No answer
""Who is it?""
There's no answer
""WHO IS IT?""

I just can't be without'cha

Contemplating, still debating
Should I just let it go

I just can't say it's love
But you already know what's up
I really can't put into words
Baby you got to feel me

That you will hold me dear
Though I'm far away
I'll whisper your name into the sky
And I will wake up happy

I wonder why I feel so high
Though I am not above the sorrow
Heavy hearted
Till you call my name
And it sounds like church bells
Or the whistle of a train
On a summer evening
I'll run to meet you
Barefoot, barely breathing

As I lay me down to sleep (ooh la kah koh)

He is the family's captain and chief, but once
I choked when my 'snus' caught up in my throat
'Cause there was our pop in the oak

They were drunk as the skunks, they were on their way back from the saloon. they passed steve harlow's range to wrestle some cattle. the marshall and his deputies showed up and shot 'em in the neck. the most bloody fireworks dog head city had ever seen. jim, the oldest brother and head of the clan since father judas got his head blown of in a gunfight, saddled up his horse and went in to town, just to set things straight with the marshall. on his way to town he rode past his uncle jock's to fill him in about joe and jeramiha.
""Looks like the marshall wants a war and he's gonna get one"", jock said. ""i'll send a message out for brother james, your uncle. remember him? you met at the wedding when he stole your cousin julia from the groom."" meanwhile, in town, marshall monroe and his deputies were drinking their heads off and shootin' run away chickens to celebrate the passing of the mckenzies.
Next morning, the mckenzie clan were ready to set things straight with the marshall and his men. they sent little john into town to lure 'em out and into a trap, so they can shoot 'em dead.
John came to town, walked into the saloon, saw the marshall eatin' lunch. baked beans, sollie belly and a tun of brew. he saw his chance to be a man, he'd always been a little boy in the clan. he wiped his sweat of his hands and said: ""hey scumbag, this town ain't big enough for the two of us. you killed my two brothers and now, it's your time to kiss the dust. get ready to slap leather.""
But before john even cleared his holster, the marshall had filled him with so much lead, it took six strong men to carry him out. mike monroe finished his meal, reloaded his gun, gathered his men and said: ""it's time to finish the mckenzies, once and for all.""

Funny style cat
And his girl looked like a turtle
Not Lisa Turtle, just a turtle
High school track,
He ran the hurdle
His peers shed tears senior year when he got murdered
Now Alberto was your average A student
Participated in class,
Never came late
And never truant
His family was picture perfect
His older sister was prom queen
His dad a decorated vet from the Vietnam team
His mother was Dear Abby,
An ordinary house wife
Like clockwork, always had dinner on the table at 5
But Alberto had a monster he kept under his bed
Instead of letting it out,
He just got a girlfriend instead
She knew something was funny
She could tell by his behavior
Or the way he flamboyantly shook his hand
When he would wave to her
She thought nothing of it
And just shoved it in the closet
Until the day that word dripped out like leaky faucet
Alberto was homosexual
I ain't have nothing against it
But little Ronnie Johnson and all his football player friends did
They'd always pick and nag
Call him fag and such and such
And couldn't wait to get to gym so they could really bust his nuts
The gym teacher never cared
He'd just join in on the action
He'd make silly gestures
And compared him to Micheal Jackson
Alberto couldn't take it
He'd just stop showing up and whenever he walked them halls
He just felt like throwin' up
And night he would cry and cry and ask God why?
Like God, why the fuck'd I have to be born this way?
God would reply, Son, you've gotta show 'em you're more than gay
See he had dreams to be a track star
Until that warm April night
Them gay jokes went way too far
Ronnie begged for his forgiveness

And don't stell me that you think I'm really hot
If you want me for your girlfriend

Action speaks louder than words
Let's see what you can do
See if you are coming through
Before I'm giving in to attraction
I gotta check out the action

I wonder if you're equipped
And if you can't deliver the time

There are times when you feel
That you don't know where you fit in
So you hide
What is real
Even when it hurts to pretend
To be the one that you think
Everybody wants you to be
No one sees
Yeah

The one you really are
But you don't have to hide your heart
Cause nothing 'bout you needs to change
Sometimes it might seem hard
And your whole world falls apart
Just know that when you feel that way

Everybody cries
It's okay to doubt
Yourself sometimes

I wish nothing but the best for you both
An older version of me
Is she perverted like me
Would she go down on you in a theatre
Does she speak eloquently
And would she have your baby
I'm sure she'd make a really excellent mother

'Cause the love that you gave that we made wasn't able
To make it enough for you to be open wide, no
And every time you speak her name
Does she know how you told me you'd hold me
Until you died, till you died
But you're still alive

And I'm here to remind you
Of the mess you left when you went away

Got hurt majorly, finds it tough to trust.
Looked at the ashtray, then looked back up,
Spinning it away on the tabletop.
She looked much fitter than Saturday just.
She worked in JD's with dan.
Back then I figured she was pretty damn rough,
But she was only wearing her work stuff.
And in these clothes she looked more than buff,
She stirred her straw, sat up to adjust.
I told her I thought it was important,
That you could get lost in conversation.
Chattin shit, sittin in, oblivion
With that person who's your special one.
She said she was the worst pool player under the sun,
But blokes go easy so she always won.

I saw this thing on ITV the other week,
Said, that if she played with her hair, she's probably keen
She's playing with her hair, well regularly,
So I reckon I could well be in.

She didn't look too bored with what I was saying.
Her hair looked much better than the other day.
She had her fingers 'round her hair, playin'.
I Saw on the telly that's a good indication.
She didn't offer to buy the next drink though, ""Nay.""
Suppose that's just our girl's way.
I'm trying to think what else I could say,
Peelin' the label off, spinning the ashtray.
Yeah actually, yes, she did look pretty neat.

She took it all, but left me some

What you doin tonight? you should stop by the site
We could, roll some weed play some records and talk
I got a fly spot downtown Brooklyn, New York

Now I know you think I wanna fuck, no doubt
But tonight we'll try a different route, how bout we start
With a salad, a fresh bed of lettuce with croutons
Later we can play a game of chess on the futon

See I ain't got to get in your blouse
It's your eye contact, that be getting me aroused
When you show me your mind, it make me wanna show you mines
Reflecting my light, when it shines, just takin' our time

Before the night's through, we could get physical too
I ain't tryin' to say I don't wanna fuck, 'cause I do

I like to know what I'm gettin' into

Follows wherever I go
In the roarin' traffic's boom
In the silence of my lonely room

Drift to you, you're all I hear

I never thought that I
Had any more to give
Pushing me so far
Here I am without you
Drink to all that we have lost
Mistakes we have made
Everything will change
But love remains the same

I find a place where we escape
Take you with me for a space

I walk the streets through seven bars

But I knew it was a horrid tragedy

Ways to make the tiny satisfaction disappear

Blow out the candles
In on all my Frankensteins
At least my death wish will come true
Taste like Valentine's
And we cry, you're like a birthday

It lasted longer than you

Are different than mine

In my rear view
I watch you
And I gave you your life
But you give me mine
I see you slowly swim away
As the light is leaving town
To a place that I can't be
But there's no apologies

Just go on
Just go on
There're still so many things
I want to say to you

Said go mine the sun

You rolled your eyes as the world burned
The heavens fell, the earth quaked

No, you were sleeping

You grew your power garden
For your little ones
And you found brides for them on christmas eve
They hung young cain from the adam trees
And danced
While you were sleeping

Til i closed my eyes
But the future burned
Through the planet turned a hair gray

You're never alone
There's people around
But do you wanna go my way?

They threw me out of town, said I'm a hooligan
They never want to see my ugly face again
I'm looking for a ride, I need to get someplace
I'm feeling disillusioned with the human race

Heat on the skyline, have you got the time?
I'll sit here by the road for yet another day
But whatever road you're taking, I will go that way

You'd think I'd despise you
But in the end, I wanna thank you
'Cause you made me that much stronger

Well, I thought I knew you
Thinkin' that you were true
Guess I, I couldn't trust, called your bluff
Time is up 'cause I've had enough

You were there by my side
Always down for the ride
But your joy ride just came down in flames
'Cause your greed sold me out in shame

After all of the stealing and cheating
You probably think that I hold resentment for you
But uh-uh, oh no, you're wrong
'Cause if it wasn't for all that you tried to do
I wouldn't know just how capable I am to pull through
So I wanna say thank you

'Cause it makes me that much stronger
Makes me work a little bit harder
Makes me that much wiser
So thanks for making me a fighter
Made me learn a little bit faster
Made my skin a little bit thicker
Makes me that much smarter
So thanks for making me a fighter

Want your skin up against mine
Move my hips to the baseline

Put my back into a slow grind

I'd like to give you all the reasons and what everything meant

Well I could tell you goodbye or maybe see you around
With just the touch of a sarcastic thanks
We started out with a bang and at the top of the world
Now the guns are exhausted and the bullets are blanks
And everything's blank

If I could only find the words then I would write it all down
If I could only find a voice I would speak
Oh, it's there in my eyes, oh, can't you see me tonight?
C'mon and look at me and read 'em and weep
If I could only find the words then I would write it all down
If I could only find a voice I would speak
Oh, it's there in my eyes, oh, can't you see me tonight?
Come on and look at me and read 'em and weep

I've been whispering softly, trying to build a cry up into a scream
We let the past slip away and put the future on hold

Si no fuera por eso no estaría aquí
Nunca me rendí a pesar de todo
Cuando empece estaba tan solo
Nunca me aceptaron hasta que el niño creció
Y dejo de ser tan malo
Ya no llegaban los disparos
Faltaban agallas en esas manos
Conocí a mis hermanos
Los primeros que me apoyaron
Esa familia nunca sera pasado
Están presentes en cada paso
En mis gloria y y fracasos
Les debo todo ellos me enseñaron el valor
A como exterminar el miedo siendo solo yo
Por eso hoy les canto esta canción
Manteniendo viva aquella ilusión

Came to the world in the usual way
But there were planes to catch and bills to pay
He learned to walk while I was away
He was talkin' 'fore I knew it
And as he grew he said
""I'm gonna be like you, Dad
You know I'm gonna be like you""

And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man on the moon
""When you comin' home?""
""Son, I don't know when
We'll get together then
You know we'll have a good time then""

Well, my son turned ten just the other day
He said, ""Thanks for the ball, Dad. Come on, let's play
Could you teach me to throw?"" I said, ""Not today
I got a lot to do."" He said, ""That's okay""
And he walked away and he smiled and he said
""You know
I'm gonna be like him, yeah

I woke with something in my head
I couldn't escape the memory
Of a phone call and of what you said
Like a game show contestant with a parting gift

I could not believe my eyes
When I saw through the voice of a trusted friend
Who needs to humour me and tell me lies
Yeah humour me and tell me lies

And I'll lie too and say I don't mind
And as we seek so shall we find
And when you're feeling open I'll still be here
But not without a certain degree of fear

Of what will be with you and me
I still can see things hopefully
But you

Why you wanna give me a run-around
Is it a sure-fire way to speed things up
When all it does is slow me down

And shake me and my confidence
About a great many things

I knew i had to have you

We was working at the snack bar on my vacation admiration infatuation elation we were kickin it for the whole damn summer
From friends
To best friends
To part time lovers
Now you're moving in the first date of september
I can remember when i saw you back in december
It was so cold outside
You was breakin up
And so was i and
Neither one of us wanted to give love a try
But we would talk, talk, laugh and have a ball
But then we got drunk and fooled around and had a booty call
A booty call
Ain't nuthin wrong with a bootycall

No request is gonna go unheard
I'll take my time when I'm lovin' you
Foreplay at one won't end 'til two

Tell me what you need
Tell me if it ain't good enough for you baby

And nine destructive winters
There was hardly nothing left

But a bare and sore ground
Lite a stripped and dried out soul
Without body and skin

And the cold wind blew the hazel trees
And the cold wind blew the hazel trees
Reminding them of how old they are

Suddenly a force from above
Silenced the elegy
It was at the end of the day
It was at the end of the day

Lucy was 7 and wore a head of blue barrettes
City born, into this world with no knowledge and no regrets
Had a piece of yellow chalk with which she'd draw upon the street
The many faces of the various locals that she would meet
There was Joshua, age 10
Bully up the block
Who always took her milk money at the morning bus stop
There was Mrs. Crabtree and her poodle
She always gave a wave and holler on her weekly trip down to the bingo parlor
And she drew: men, women, kids, sunsets, clouds
And she drew: skyscrapers, fruit stands, cities, towns
Always said hello to passers-by
They'd ask her why she passed the time
Attachin' lines to concrete
But she would only smile
Now all the other children living in or near her building
Ran around like tyrants, soaking up the open fire hydrants
They would say
""Hey little Lucy, wanna come jump double dutch?""
Lucy would pause, look, grin and say
""I'm busy, thank you much""
Well, well, one year passed
And believe it or not

Point to the sky feel free
A sea of people all equal smiles in front and behind me
Swim in the deep blue sea cornfields sway lazily
All smiles all easy where you from, what you on and what's your story
Mesmerizing tones rising pianos this is my zone so stop cloning
Pick paper scissors or stone
Cause me and you are same i known
You all my life i don't know your name
The names European Bob sorted anyway
Gonna have dance now see you later please to meet you
Likewise a pleasure

We were just standing there minding our own
And it went on and on
We all smile we all sing
The weak become heroes then the stars align
We all sing we all sing all sing

The night slowly fades and goes slow motion
All the commotion becomes floating emotions
Same piano loops over
Arms wave eyes roll back and jaws fall open

His little hand grasped in anguish as he weighed up his coin
Somewhere a blue eyed girl in the world is just waiting for a boy

Footprints trailed as if trod by slaves up to the gray cave floor
But not one graze from anything ever escaping this fort
So with coin on hand his joy came back when ordered to take the shore
Why on earth, as he wandered the warmth am I obeying this coin

Turn upside, a choice you'd normally avoid
And promise me you'll follow what it says
Whatever it says

Time after time after time
The conversation drifts
In no general direction

And your aural love
Is keeping me from bed
And it's talking and talking
It's all you ever said
You know it's all you want
All you want
It's all you want
All you want

You don't fool me, you don't fool me
No surprises, no surprises
Love in the hallway
Sex on the carpet
Antagonism rising
You know you try to categorise me
Because it's all you ever wanted
It's all you want
All you want
It's all you want
All you want

But you're changing my love
'Cos all you want is - television!

No heart is infected

In whatever I do
Burn like a good bonfire
And I know I'll come through

The time is long overdue for a house clearing of the soul
We all get so complicated in our lives

Spinning round and round with you
Watching shadows melt the light
Soft shining from our eyes
Into another space
Is our alone tonight
Watching shadows melt

Where all the guys were corny but the girls were mad fly
Lounging with the Tipster, cooling with Sha
Scoping out the honeys—they know who they are
I was the b-ball playing, fly rhyme saying
Fly girl getting but never was I sweating
Cause when it came to honeys I would go on a stroll
Until I met my match—her name was Flo
Yeah, I messed around with the one called Flo
All the troopers 'round the way used to call her a ho
But deep down in my heart I knew that Flo was good to go
Cause I thought it was me like Bell Biv Devoe
But little did I know that she was playing with my mind
The only thing I learned is good girls are hard to find
I feel like Heavy D I need somebody for me
Not someone whose mind is blank
And trying to juice me for my banks
Swinging with my main man Lucky behind my back
What type of crap is that—yo, how's about a smack?
Word life, I can't front, thought I was all that
But now it seems, I've met my match
I was a stone cold lover, you couldn't tell me jack
Settling down with one girl, wasn't trying to hear that
I had Tonya, Tamika, Sharon, Karen, Tina, Stacy, Julie, Tracy
Used to love 'em, leave 'em, skeeze 'em, tease 'em
Find 'em, lose 'em - also abuse 'em

In the high animated world

If you take a shit they want to know
And if you're gonna fall, they won't be around, y'all
So you still wanna do the show business?
And you think that you got what it takes?
I mean you really gotta rap and be all that
And prepare yourself for the breaks

[Heir Apparent arrangement by Terry Gorle 1987]

Hello darkness my old friend
I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left it's seeds while I was sleeping
And a vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains -
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a streetlamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
-That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never share
-And no one dared
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools"", said I, ""You do not know""
""Silence, like a cancer, grows""
""Hear my words, that I might teach you""

And pigs are not flying, or turning the cogs

All the stars wouldn't fall from the sky
And the moon wouldn't start to cry
There'd be no earthquakes
I'd still make mistakes

Remember every little lie
And every last goodbye
Promises you broke, words you choked on
And I never walked away
It's still a mystery to me

I'm better off without you
And you're better off without me
Well you're so unclean
I'm better off without you
And you're better off without me

The bleeding!
The screaming! Was tearing me apart!
The hatred!
Deceiving!

You slept through it all
And these four walls warn you
That your surgery, it might not be the key
To fix the memory of you and me

Doctor I don't know what I'm gonna do
I need this song to be shouted out
And to be heard by everyone
Its like each word and every chord refuses to be ignored

Lover and a song in your head. The deaths of countless
Others simply set up the lyrics for your symphony.
That's where you'll find me.

Shit, I know how this movie ends, still I play
The starring role in ""Hovito's Way""

It's just life, I solemnly swear
To change my approach, stop shaving coke
Stay away from hoes, put down the toast

But every time I felt ""That was that"", it called me right back

I looked at my phone 'cause it keeps me company
I called you as I hired the car
To ask you how far is it there from you to me
And I wrote directions on the back of an old magazine

But you are too beautiful to be in bed with me
Yeah, you are too beautiful to be in bed with me
If you could see the thoughts I see
If you could see my faults, baby, you'd agree

It's no way to be

Higher and higher and higher

Up and up I keep on climbing

The spattered colors of ecstatic fright

How I wish I could be sure it's me that turns you on
Each time you close your eyes
I've heard it said that dreamers never lie

You've been talking in your sleep
Sleeping in your dreams

Worrying about the future don't change the past
Used to think that tomorrow would be better
But now i know that i'm doing the best i can
I'm just a man trying to find the reasons why i stand
Took some time to realize that i am what i am
And i wanna be rich, i wanna be happy
And live inside a love that shines bright enough to last a lifetime
I wanna be rich more than a fantasy
Ride the winds and climb, cause it's all a state of mind

Wake up in the morning and i turn the pages
Don't understand what's going down

In our hearts and in our minds

Hearts and minds begin to see
That one and all means you and me
And what we know can set us free
Rearrange reality

Reality is what we know
We can change a river' s flow
Plant a seed, watch it grow
Build a shelter, build a home

Home is where my heart will stay
Even when I' m far away
Makes no difference what they say
As long as you will be my

Than talk with you,

There's space for us to shake,
And 'hey, I like this tune'.

Even if I could hear what you said,
I doubt my reply would be interesting
For you to hear.
Because I haven't read a single book all year,
And the only film I saw,
I didn't like it at all.

Then you said to so long
Left me standing all alone
Alone and crying.

And I just got to make my break

They shove it down your throat""

Only antidote to keep my temperature
From runnin' wild

Hot potato to my aid
She's the girl with the swirl
Like air-conditioned lemonade
But the lady's on the hot-plate
Daddy's threatened to disown

Billy lay in love with Marianne
She was a rich judge's daughter
He was a son of a miner
But that night, their love was more than they could stand

The judge said to his daughter
""That son of that coal miner
Is someone you'd do well to leave alone""
She knew her dad so well
She knew she couldn't tell
But the truth was bound to show before too long
Their love had started growing on its own

You can't outrun the long arm of the law
No, you can't outrun the long arm of the law

Billy placed his hand on Mary
And he felt the baby movin'
Kissed her and said, ""I'll see you when I can""
The judge had made a promise
When he caught up with Billy
He'd send him far away from Marianne

And you might have lots of mines

I hate the feeling when you're lookin' at me that way

But if we act all shy, it'll make it okay

And ev'ry stop is neatly planned for a poet and a one-man band.
Homeward bound,
I wish I was,
Homeward bound,
Home where my thought's escaping,
Home where my music's playing,
Home where my love lies waiting
Silently for me.
Ev'ry day's an endless stream

I've got some real estate here in my bag.
So we bought a pack of cigarettes and Mrs Wagner pies
And we walked off to look for America.

Michigan seems like a dream to me now
It took me four days to hitchhike from Saginaw
I've come to look for America

Of arguments and lies

For now I'm mesmerised
And I'm staring down the barrel of my life

Now I'm entranced, you possess my full attention
How my thoughts dance freely on the journey
You intended all along, to somewhere I belong
Like a pilot in the sky of dreams

Can you promise me the world
And everything I need
Can you promise me the world
Can you promise me a sky
That's trouble free and clear
So it's safe for me to fly

But who can stop my plane (stop my plane)
From drifting out of range (far away)

Will this sky be precious to defend
Will my sights go dark before the end

Pay two mortgages and leccy bills
Been comfortable and that
Nobody told her
That she'd ever reach the stage
Where her husband bored or her
Or she lied about her age
He's compromising

At least he's got a job for life
Get born, get school, get job, get car
Pay tax and find a wife
And on that note
The end can't come too soon
If you're not living on the edge
You take up too much room
I could've been a contender

Could've been a someone
Caught up in the rat race
And feeling like a no-one
Appearing in the papers (?)

Being Bruce Lee
But the need for chops in the Manor top
Aint all that great you see

At least so you could see the white of their eyes
Bright with surprise once they finish spittin lies

Others make us laugh like the Sunday funnies
Fam be around whether you paid or bummy
You could either ignore this advice or take it from me
Be too nice and people take you for a dummy

Don't want to be an outlaw always on the run
Don't want to be a climber reaching for the top

Looking into the rear-view
As the roads fade away
I've sworn off my past
The first to last bad call

And tell me how to make right
Every wrong turn that I've learned

So this could all end tonight

Well, it's my heart I'll follow this time

I was cracked out, I was caved in

It ended kinda medical
It came on hot and soft

Artilleryman: We're gonna build a whole new world for ourselves. Look, they clap eyes on us and we're dead, right? So we gotta make a new life where they'll never find us. You know where? Underground.

You should see it down there - hundreds of miles of drains - sweet and clean now after the rain, dark, quiet, safe. We can build houses and everything, start again from scratch.

And what's so bad about living underground eh? It's not been so great living up here, if you want my opinion.

Take a look around you at the world we've come to know
Does it seem to be much more than a crazy circus show
But maybe from the madness something beautiful will grow
In a brave new world
With just a handful of men
We'll start - we'll start all over again - all over again - all over again - all over again

We'll build shops and hospitals and barracks right under their noses - right under their feet! Everything we need - banks, prisons and schools... We'll send scouting parties to collect books and stuff, and men like you'll teach the kids. Not poems and rubbish - science, so we can get everything working. We'll build villages and towns and... and... we'll play each other at cricket! Listen, maybe one day we'll capture a fighting machine, eh? Learn how to make 'em ourselves and then wallop! Our turn to do some wiping out! Whoosh with our Heat Ray - Whoosh! And them running and dying, beaten at their own game. Man on top again!

Holding hands and skimming stones
Had an old gold Chevy, and a place of my own

Was doing a thing called the Crocodile Rock
While the other kids were rocking 'round the clock
We were hopping and bopping to the Crocodile Rock, well

Crocodile rocking is something shocking
When your feet just can't keep still
I never knew me a better time and I guess I never will
Oh, lawdy mama those Friday nights
When Suzie wore her dresses tight
And the Crocodile rocking was out of sight

No one much around but us
Then I see this young boy
Caught a look at me

I'm stunned in a daze
He had the whole street set ablaze
It's only love they say
Makes you feel this way

She liked his eyes, she wanted more
The baby gonna have your smile for sure
He saw a lovely girl
Smelling sweet and soapy like fresh air
She saw him looking, acted like she didn't care
That's how we knew
And so love grew a flower
A flower that is you

Your daddy knows you're a flame
Your daddy knows you're a flame
Your daddy knows you're a flame
Your daddy knows you're a flame

Even to the angels it may sound like a lie

That someone came and stole your bike
And I said don't worry
But don't you go and take a hike
It takes one to know one
There's always someone on the prowl
It takes one to know one

And you say you're sorry
That we're all mindless animals

Children of the night, can you hear them all calling?
Skies open up and the angel starts falling
Listen to the beasts, can you hear them hollering?

Start in the morning through 'til the evening
Dance like you are the only one around
Move like you want it, groove like you need it
Dance, lose it all 'til the sun goes down

Free your mind 'cause tonight we are gonna break it down
Shake it, make it, funky down
Get so high as the toxins in your body
Are the bass and drums and the ra ra ra

We are right on time
And all is fine
If you've lost your senses
Here have mine and

Lose yourself
From the time you awake
'Til the evening time
Until the sunshine breaks, and come on

Littering my shore
This is the last true burning letter
Given to a girl
Written by a boy
Living in a world created to destroy

But if I built you a city, would you let me
Would you tear it down?

But there you go for the last time
I finally know now what I should have known then
That I could still be ruthless if you'll let me
But there you go and I'm not done
You're waving goodbye, but at least you're having fun
The rising tide will not let you forget me

With the pigeon with lazarus billy goat whiskers

See naked martyrs with Bubblicious on fishing rods

Allow the details later and the crews will taper out

Through piggy jammy happy shooting at the bladed mouth
Bazooka tooths who keep the paper route
With janky funds and favors
Cradled by twelve empty Zelda heart containers

Winter forever
Like Punxsutawney Phil down with his four furry wrists severed
I walk face first through the sex, guns, and church
With wild things that make Maurice Syndek question his early works
But no hostages no promises
Out the claw of corporate cogs and sprockets,
Now clogs off gromits
Running from a rabid ring wraith click, basilisk, serpentine
In and out of traffic jam and murder scenes
Scrub blood off the AF1 fifty two pick up first degree
Some toddler's smuggled tommy guns and crack into the nurseries

So dust off the candelabra, hip hop's version of the super Don Dada
With the license to give more ass whippings than Father
You couldn't see me with binoculars, way ahead of myself like telepathy
Make most crews disappear like blackheads on Oxy creme
Under the lights I fuck up mics with my uncanny ability to heat seek
Through brain facilities with the science of microchemistry

A sandwich still ain't nothing but a hero

Then mountains I could move
And if walls could speak I'd pray

We never find these locks still open

The lines we cross in search of change

Although we have no obligation
To stay alive
On broken backs we beg for mercy
We will survive

Some people lie and demand the truth
I gotta ask myself if it's soul deception
Is this the natural thing that we all just do

We take such pleasure from pain, just tired of playing that game
Some things you've got to change

You've got to stand and deliver, with your body and soul
Stand and deliver, just give me something to hold
Stand and deliver, if the truth can be told
We can make it together, if we stand - stand and deliver

Sometimes my mind drives me to distraction
I want to shut all the windows and lock the doors

No matter what you do still some things never change
Seen a lot of the world, met a lot of friends
Got a lot of fond memories
There's nothing like playing a basement show
On a saturday night in Pennsylvania.

Start the show, here we go
Jumping in the crowd
We've gotta tear this building down.

To try and ruin our fun.

Just how it's done.

And I need to be redeemed
To the one I've sinned against
Because he's all I ever knew of love

Heaven help me for the way I am

You've got to go faster than that to get to the top.
Dirty old mountain
All covered in smoke, she can turn you to stone
So you better start doing it right
Better start doing it right.

And the pack on your back is turning you around.
Throw it away, you won't need it up there, and remember
You don't look back whatever you do.
Better start doing it right.

Soon the cold will start to bite
And I'm kicking some old
Empty can
Down a barren street yah
Step into a dark saloon
Peer across the smoke filled room
I can feel her a mile away
She smiles and beckons me

Now we're dancing throught the mist
Face to face I taste her breath
Our gaze locks into a hazy trance I start to quiver
Now she comes to comfort me I tell her I'm too blind to see

And I guess there's not much in his little mind
It's a shame when it happens every day

With a fire in my bones and the sweet taste of kerosene

In the dark of the night, I can hear you calling my name
With the hardest of hearts I still feel full of pain
So I drink and I smoke, and I ask you if you're ever around
Even though it was me who drove us right in the ground

Never knowing I'd be singing this song some day
And now I'm sinking,
Sinking to rise no more
Ever since you
Closed the door

If I could turn,
Turn back the hands of time
Then my darlin' you'd still be mine
If I could turn,
Turn back the hands of time
Then darlin' you, you'd still be mine
Funny,

Funny how time goes by

And blessings are missed
In the wink of an eye
Why oh why oh why
Should one have to go on suffering
When every day I pray
Please come back to me
If... I could turn

Turn back the hands of time
Then my darling you

You would be mine

Every move I make your ass got something to say
Scandalize my name when you see it in the paper
Trying to turn it all around when it wasn't that way
Everybody is trying to figure me out
What the hell is wrong with y'all just let me live my life
I can't go one day without y'all in my face
Y'all done lost y'all minds if you don't hear what I say
Cops chase me when I'm standing still
You know I ain't done shit wrong so why you want me in your cell
You don't like my songs well it pays the bills
And you cut me down cuz I keep it real
Sometimes I wanna fly far away from here
To another place it ain't worth these tears
Sometimes at night when I close my eyes
I know the haters are busy making up hater lies
Sometimes I laugh trying to keep from crying
If I was plain out of love then tell me who could I trust

From people busting caps and like Mandela being free

Where the hell can Nicki be? I'm gonna smack her up
I got the tickets for the Knicks and she cold stood me up

Pulled out my book of hoes, oh yo Sheila's home
Steady smilin like a mother yo I'm read' to bone
Went down to hon, she's in the red zone

With all these trials and tribulations yo I've been affected

Feelin like I'm chillin' on a Caribbean island
Rugged, raw material is what we bring forth

What's that you're sayin' in the back, actin' all silly
Kickin' freestyle raps, rollin' up phillies

It's the four man fiasco in charge like Roscoe
Now you get the picture like Picasso
We make it happen when these niggaz start rappin'
Who this, captain?
Stick out your hand, you gets no dap and.
I got the Razor, got the Phife, I got the Shaheed
Now all you shorties move your ass while you puff weed
Blessin' fans with autographs in my paths
While other rappers get gassed, they be defeating the task

Yo, if I ruled the world
It wouldn't be that gassed shit, niggaz will make the light swirl
Cuz after you G, ain't nuthin' but Girl... Scouts

'Cause she didn't want parades just passing by her
So she painted on a smile and took up with some clown
While she danced without a net upon the wire

Don't cry out loud
Just keep it inside
And learn how to hide your feelings
Fly high and proud
And if you should fall
Remember you almost had it all

Image of wretchedness.
Divine like no other.
Kiss the poison breast.
Flamed like the sun.
Lives made undone.
Words soft as snow.
Souls claimed and won.
An opiate drugged haze.
Beds of shapeless dust.

Gentle in the night's breeze
I stop and stare, rest a while
With hands upon my knees
Through jaded leaves, bush and scrub
I spy my journey's end
Black it looms, silent gloom
The castle called Avend
On I trot, past forest eyes
Past horrors of the night
Through the dark, I see a sign
A gentle glowing light

Upon reaching the castle I ascend the ivy
Towards the golden window
My heart pounds, my breath is rushed
As I fight both brick and branch
The ledge is mine and over I sweep
Silent like the falling snow
Quiet, I slip across the polished floor

Stands forever, alone in the sea
Of rock and of sand and grass
And shale, the isle bereft of trees.

- Small. A speck in the wide blue
Sea. 'Tis the last of all the land.
A dweller upon our lonesome
Isle, the last, lonely man? -

By the Gods he is there to
Never leave, to remain all his
Life. His punishment for
Evermore, to attend the
Eternal light.

The lighthouse, tall and brilliant
White, which stands at the end
Of the world. Protecting ships
And sailors too, from rock they
Could be hurled

Yet nothing comes and nothing
Goes 'sept the bright blue sea.
Which stretches near and far
Away, 't is all our man can see.

Though, one day, up high on
Rock, a bird did perch and cry.
An albatross, he shot a glance,
And wondered deeply, why?

Could it be a watcher sent?
A curse sent from the Gods,
Who sits and cries and stares at him,
The life that they have robbed.

Each year it comes to watch
Over him, the creature from above.
Not a curse but a reminder of
The woman that he loved.

- Oh weary night, under stars,
He'd lay and gaze.
Up towards the moon and stars.
The suns dying haze.

Time and again, Orion's light
Filled our man with joy.
Within the belt, he'd see his love,
Remembering her voice -

The twinkle from the stars above
Bled peace into his heart
As long as she looks down on him
He knows they'll never part

One day good, one day bad
The madness, the heat, the sun,
Out to sea, he spies upon land.
His beloved Albion.

Slow raining heat.
Lapping at your skin
Pulling you down again.

Fan back to life
The dying embers
Of my long lost passion.

Descending deeper.
With black as my light.
With twist and turn.
All men will be tried in life.

We look for light to call.
The call to save us all.
Lest we fall to our knees.
The death, we kiss his feet.
Oh, sacred mother come.
For our fate is done.
In blindness do we run
Always backwards.

And I'll dissect you like a fraction

Two lovers in love can't make it

And America hates me for what I am

Of what you have eaten, I'm a rock 'n roll nigger

Baby was a black sheep, baby was a whore
Baby's gotten big and baby's gettin' bigger
Baby got somethin', baby want more
Baby, baby, baby was a rock 'n roll nigger

How do you like the world around you?
Do you like what you see?

Ready to be

Outside of society
Waitin' for me
Outside of society

Like you want somebody to talk to you mama
Don't get smart with her have a heart to heart with her
Just like you would with your daughter
Cause everything you do or say
You gotta live with it everyday
She's somebody's baby
She's somebody's sista
She's somebody's mama

Now when you got to her speak truthfully
Be honest as you can be, from your heart
You're in a situation, where ya losing patience
Take some time and look her in the eye
When you just can't find the words you want
And it's hard to reach the point
Where you both can understand
Don't just tell the truth
Tell the whole truth
It'll make a better man outta you

When you talk to her, talk to her
Like you want somebody to talk to your mama
Don't get smart with her have a heart to heart
With her just like you would with your daughter
Cause everything you do or say
You gotta live with it everyday
She's somebody's baby
She's somebody's sista
She's somebody's mama

It doesn't matter if she's wearin
A mini skirt or a business suit
Whether she's 25 or 99
Treat her the way your mama taught you to

You forgot that broach of your mother's
Every time I try to cut the cord
You come crawling back with some excuse

There's nothing good about goodbye
I could swear I saw you cry
I always knew you'd wind up fa-falling harder

Just say goodbye

But then you called again
To tell me how you're gonna blow my best friend

A million miles from everything we've ever known
We're on their hearts and minds
A million heads are bowed to bring us safely home
Hemmed in by emptiness
A million ways that everything could be undone

Is filled with reasons not to sing but I found one
I know

We are not alone
We feel an unseen love
We are sons and heirs of grace
We are children of
A light that never dims
A love that never dies

The one I felt the safest with
The one who knew just what to say
To make me laugh again
Let the light back in
I miss my friend
I miss the colors that you brought into my life
Your golden smile with those blue-green eyes

When I've reached out for you you've always been there

To keep me sane in this life that I lead
Now I'm not with you and my broken heart bleeds
I never knew lonely 'til you.

Between us days are filled with dreams
Scorpions crawl across my screen
Make their home beneath my skin
Underneath my dress stick their tongues
Bite through the flesh down to the bone
And I have been so fuckin' alone
Since those three days

Did you only want me for those three days?
Did you only need me for those three days?
Did you love me forever
Just for those three days?

You built a nest inside my soul
You rest your head on leaves of gold
You managed to crawl inside my brain
You found a hole and in you came
You sleep like a baby breathing

But didn't know in '63 he had died

Does she think this world is all wrong?
Does she think I'll rob her and run?

And simply says, ""Scat, boy, scat, scat""

With me
A year to the day;
Three hundred
And sixty
Five days watching me decay

We used to talk about girls who play guitars
We used to talk about plans in tiny bars

In the gaps
Between words
Are the things that really intrigue me.
It's the gasps
And the sighs
That say more about what's inside you

We used to climb aboard our high horse every time
We used to talk about boys with missing spines

It's her life and life worth living.

Cross the railroad tracks

Way in the back
Where I sit alone
And think of losing you

I spend most every night
Beneath the light

There's always room here for the lonely
To watch your broken dreams
Dance in and out of the beams
Of a neon moon

When it's nice and cold I can hold my baby closer to me
And collect the kisses that are due me
I love the winter weather
Because I've got my love to keep me warm
I love the winter weather
'Cause that's when you and I can get together
There's nothing sweeter, finer
When there's ice and snow

It really don't make any difference now to me

I pay no mind to the negative kind

I don't stop to please someone else's needs
Gonna live my life for me

I'm gonna keep on
I'm gonna do my own thing
We've all got a song that we're meant to sing
And no matter what people say or might think
I ain't going no place, no I'm here to stay
Gonna keep on doing my thing

I'll still be the same girl I used to be
'Cause I ain't going no place
No I'm here to stay, ohh yeah
I'm here to stay, ohh yeah

I've never been the type to be shy
I know some would say I'm too headstrong.
But i'd rather be a woman who voices her mind
Whether you think I'm right or wrong
And I know some people wanna criticize
Makes them feel better about themselves
So say what you will, time will reveal

Shot me down with a revolver, got me high

Then all the colours of the rainbow
Fell in my eyes

And throw little things off

Like Car parts, bottles and cutlery
Or whatever I find
Lying around

It's become a habit
A way to start the day

I go through all this
Before you wake up

So I can feel happier

To be safe up here with you

I go through all this
Before you wake up

Don't leave me here to crawl through the mire.
I'm without fault before the throne of god.
Take from me the crown of sympathy.
What do you think you'll see?

Elaborate, scented coiffers.

Vast is the heirs ballroom.
Let the rich give you presents.

The fumes of rich swine, honeyglazed and dripping, playing in the air.
My mouth eager and wishing.
But I return to this nightingale.
Her hair all fiery red.

There i was giggling about the games that i had played with many hearts
And i'm not sayin' no names.

As i said to myself when am i gonna learn?
I can feel it inside, i can't explain how it feels
All i know is that i'll never dish another raw deal
Playin' make believe, pretending that i'm true,
Holding in my laugh as i say that i love you.

Saying no more, kissing you on the ear,
Whispering 'i love you and i'll always be here,
Although i always reminisce, i can believe that i found
A desire for true love floating around inside my soul
Because my soul is cold, one half of me deserves to be this way

I go wild

A little country song

And I took your childish laughter by surprise
And at the moment that my camera happened to find you
There was just a trace of sorrow in your eyes

Now, the things that I remember seem so distant and so small
Though it hasn't really been that long a time

Take your time when you likin a guy
Cause if he sense that your feelings too intense, it's pimp or die
I bought you earrings on your birthday
Drove you to college your first day
It must be sad, though it hurts to say
We could never be a item, don't even like him
You deserve better - this is ugly; Gina, please don't love me
There's better guys out there other than me

And I know what makes me tick
And when I need to get my way
I know how to pour it on thick

Cream and sugar in my coffee
Right away when I awake
I face the day and pray to God
I won't make the same mistakes
All the rest is out of my hands

I will learn to let go what I cannot change
I will learn to forgive what I cannot change
I will learn to love what I cannot change
But I will change, I will change

Are goin' into this mic, written by this hand
Are comin' out of this mouth, made by this tongue
I'll tell you now my name, my name is Young

But so you think that it's your destiny
To get the best of me, but I suggest to be
Quiet, bro', don't even try it from the east and west of me
Takin' it to never breakin' it to even shakin' it
Groovin' it to always movin' it, 'cuz I'm not fakin' it

Pullin' out rhymes like books off the shelf
Born in England, raised in Hollis, taught to go for myself
This is stone cold rhymin', no frills, no fluffs
And it's no accident that these rhymes sound tough

I'm goin' off, baby, there's no turnin' back
I'm on your TV, on your album, cassette and 8-track
And when the show is finally finished I'll be takin' my bow
My name is Young, and yo I got know how, you know what I'm sayin'?

I got know how
Party people, I got know how
I kick it just like this

I got juice like the president, I'm makin' rappers hesitant
Invite me to your house and I'll be chillin' like a resident
Yes, 'cuz I'm that type of man

And without a prayer
This rain beats down like death
Turn your eyes to better men

Before I go
I'm hangin' a cross on a nail
I hung one for you in there

Girl, lay your shame to rest
And hold the lies close to your breast

That likened him to all the stories he told
Of past battles won and lost
And legends of old
A seasoned veteran in his own time

On the battlefield he gained respectful fame
With many medals of bravery and stripes to his name
He grew a beard as soon as he could to cover the scars on his face
And always urged his men on

But on the eve of a great battle with the infantry in dream
The Old General tossed in his sleep and wrestled with its meaning
He awoke from the night to tell what he had seen
And walked slowly out of his tent

All the men held tall with their chests in the air
With the courage in their blood and a fire in their stare
And it was a gray morning and they all wondered how they would fare
Till the old general told them to go home

He said, ""I have seen the others
And I have discovered
That this fight is not worth fighting
And I've seen their mothers

I said I didn't really want her ass
I went away in the mud and rain
The gang became snide and laughed
I was slayed but I smiled and the pain
Began to subside at last

And when I got back to my hotel
I wondered if the thunder meant I'd landed in hell
And on the forecourt, I slipped and fell
I cracked my stupid head and I heard a bell
I thought, hey

Somebody saved me, it happened again
Somebody saved me, I thank you, my friend
Somebody saved me, from a fate worse than heaven
'Cause if I'd had her for just an hour
I'd have wanted her forever
Somebody saved me

You would have thought that I'd have learned
Twenty years ago or more
A beautiful girl raised her mouth and yearned
But I didn't know what lips were for
I ran away in the mud and rain

It's just a song she likes
Her little arms around my neck
And a dying girl whispers in my ear

Tell me now can you feel it?

She comes to me like a piece of summer
She comes to me on the days when I need it most

The careless whisper of a good friend
To the heart and mind ignorance is kind
There's no comfort in the truth
Pain is all you'll find

I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool

I should have known better than to cheat a friend
And waste a chance that I've been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you

Should have known better, ooh...

I feel so unsure
As you take my hand
And lead me to the dance floor

As the music dies
Something in your eyes
Calls to mind a silver screen

Wet streets tryin' to remember
All the wild night breezes in your memory ever

And everything looks so complete
When you're walkin' out on the street
And the wind catches your feet
Sends you flyin', cryin'

Ooh, woo, wee
Wild night is calling, alright

Put it in a big brown bag for me
Sail right around all the seven oceans
Drop it straight into the deep blue sea

She's as sweet as tupelo honey
She's an angel of the first degree
She's as sweet, she's as sweet as tupelo honey
Just like honey, baby, from the bee

You can't stop us on the road to freedom
And you can't keep us, 'cause our eyes can see
Men with insight, men in granites
Knights in armor bent on chivalry

She's as sweet as tupelo honey
She's an angel of the first degree (She's an angel)
She's as sweet as tupelo honey
Just like honey, baby, from the bee

Somethin' good comes along
Once in a blue moon
Every thing's not goin' wrong

When you get weary
Beating on the same old going
Once in a blue moon
Someone like you comes along

Once every once in a while
Something comes along that feels just right
Once every once in a while
Just like switching on an electric light

And sometimes you try
Till you're blue in the face
But when you get that feeling
Nothings gonna take its place
