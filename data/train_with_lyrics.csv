Gently hold our heads on high

Aimless time in fear new hide
Overthrow the plan
Confusion lies in all my words
Mad is the soul

We barricade ourselves in holes of temperament
This is the dawning of a new age
A heart that beats the wrong way
Insanity's crescendo

Windcolour, second sight
A touch of silence and the violence of dark
Illusion span, the aroma of time
Shadowlife and the scent of nothingness

Infinite fall of instinct
Order of one spells deceit
Infinite lack of trust
Order of one obsolete

Oh escaping time is all we lost ahead?

Dopo che aveva pianto
Poi si schiarisce la voce
E ricomincia il canto

Te vojo bene assai
Ma tanto tanto bene sai
E' una catena ormai
Che scioglie il sangue dint'e vene sai

Vide le luci in mezzo al mare
Penso alle notti la in America
Ma erano solo le lampare
E la bianca scia di un'elica
Senti il dolore nella musica
E si alzo dal pianoforte
Ma quando vide uscire
La luna da una nuvola
Gli sembro piu dolce anche la morte
Guardo negli occhi la ragazza
Quegli occhi verdi come il mare
Poi all'improvviso usci una lacrima
E lui credette di affogare

Potenza della lirica
Dove ogni dramma e un falso
Che con un po'di trucco e con la mimica
Puoi diventare un altro
Ma due occhi che ti quardano
Cosi vicini e veri
Ti fan scordare le parole
Confondono i pensierei
Cos diventa tutto piccolo

Like you can't take your pretty eyes away from me
It's not that I don't wanna stay
But every time you come too close I move away
I wanna believe in everything that you say
'Cause it sounds so good
But if you really want me move slow
There's things about me you just have to know

Sometimes I run
Sometimes I hide
Sometimes I'm scared of you
But all I really want is to hold you tight
Treat you right, be with you day and night
Baby, all I need is time

I don't wanna be so shy uh oh

I will not break the way you did, you fell so hard
I've learned the hard way to never let it get that far

Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you
I am afraid

I lose my way and it's not too long before you point it out

Just a bit of a break from the norm
Just a little somethin' to break the monotony

A little bit outta control, it's cool to dance
But what about the groove that soothes
That moves romance?
Give me a soft subtle mix
An' if ain't broke, then don't try to fix it

An' think of the summers of the past
Adjust the base an' let the Alpine blast
Pop in my CD an' let me run a rhyme
An' put your car on cruise an' lay back

Summers is miles and miles away
And no one would ask me to stay

And I should contemplate this change
To ease the pain
And I should step out of the rain
Turn away

Keepsake cunts cut full out easing puberty through

Aah!
Nostalgia grows
Now times nine or ten
Within this vice den called a soul
Dying for resurrection
I dig deep to come again
The spasm of orgasm on a roll

I live the slow serrated rape
The bucks fizz of amyl nitrate
Victims force fed their own face
Tear stains upon the drape

To a warm Summer's day
But to the letter, it is better
To lichen their names to a grave

And do you know she just walked in
The girl is gettin' ready
She's going back out again
I said, just wait one minute

Another child, another soul, grabs a hold
To the metal that will end his misery...

You took my best friend, at the time I was blind

Like some baby Barbarella
With the stars as her umbrella
She asked me if I'd like to magnetise
Do I have to go star-trekking
'Cause it's you I should be checking
So she laser beamed me with her cosmic eyes

She's just a cosmic girl
From another galaxy
My heart's at zero gravity
She's from a cosmic world
Putting me in ecstasy
Transmitting on my frequency
She's cosmic

How many times have we been thru this
I can tell you that it's getting harder everytime I try to resist
We go way back and you held me down
Helped my feet moving on the ground
No matter what situation ocasion
You were amazing, you knew just what it took to keep dough up blazing (?)
I kept you by me, but when we seperated I was thinkin foolishly
Remember when your Ex-Boy tried to bug on me
I told to bring it on and (?) on me
He didn't like that but didn't want the fight
Fuck 'im, he didn't know how to treat you right
We go hand in hand they don't understand a man
But you do and I really respect that, damn
We been down so long but it's all good

Having a gang of fun and much too young to be wicked
'Cause when I was thirteen you know we didn't have cars
It was either double ride the peg nuts or hop on the handle bars

And then we went and bought a gang of balloons
And had a water balloon fight that lasted until the night
Then after that we played some hide and go get it
With the neighborhood home girls, dumb enough to be with it

All in fun and games and keeping it cool
But my my, when you're kicking it, time flys by
'Cause every hour's a minute and every minute's a sec
And if I came home late my moms would ring my neck, yeah

But I regret not the whoopings I got
'Cause to be able to play the next day was okay
On a mission to hit up the neighbor's fruit trees
Just a bunch of kids chillin', enjoying the summer breeze

Summer breeze, flowing like the wind
Boy you need to know that you got a friend and I'll always be here
Summer breeze, flowing like the wind
Boy you need to know that you got a friend and I'll always be here

Now I'm growing some fuzz, getting older like 17 or 18
And the only thing I know is to stay clean
T-shirt, short pants, Nike's on spotless
I was even old enough to buy me a cutlass

What's your mama's name?

Thirty some odd years ago, a young man came to Memphis
Askin' 'bout a rose that used to blossom in his world
People never took the time to mind the young man's questions
Until one day they heard him ask a little green-eyed girl

What's your mama's name, child?
What's your mama's name?
Does she ever talk about a place called New Orleans?

I can get a head-start out the door

If there's nothing missing in my life
Then why do these tears come at night?

Oh, yeah

I'm sitting here alone up in my room
And think about the times that we've been through
Oh, my love
I'm looking at a picture in my hand
Trying my best to understand
I really wanna know what we did wrong
With a love that felt so strong

If only you were here tonight
I know that we could make it right

I don't know how to live without your love
I was born to make you happy
'Cause you're the only one within my heart
I was born to make you happy
Always and forever you and me

I don't know how to live without your love

I was never one to back out of an argument and say I was wrong,
Even when I'd seen the other side
I'd hide my foolishness and carry on
But still I'd be embarrassed
'Cos they'd see what happened and they's play along
Until I back myself into a corner
I would only realise when they had gone

And like a dream, a life, a reason,
Everything must change

And like a world, this earth and seasons
Everything must change

Wanna get the drawers
Well I'm gone put my bid in
And get at you
No disrespect but I want it bad as they do
The only difference is
They look out for themselves
But I'm doing it just to hear you yell, yeah

You see what O's I'm packing

When I had you there, but then I let you go
And now it's only fair that I should let you know

A train arrives but never leaves.
It's a shame.
Oh life - like love that walks out of the door,
Of being rich or being poor.
Such a shame.
But it's then, then that faith arrives
To make you feel at least alive.
And that's why you should keep on aiming high,
Just seek yourself and you will shine.
You've go to search for the hero inside yourself,
Search for the secrets you hide.
Search for the hero inside yourself
Until you find the key to your life.
In this life, long and hard though it may seem,

There's not a thing I wouldn't do

You're black and beautiful, yellow, tan
You're white as light and soft as sand
With greens and greys and oh for days
A silver lining on the way you cover everyone
Just like a morning sun
You turn me into someone I would rather be

OOO- I love your every color

If wings take you away from me

Because you and me got a street kinda thing goin' on

Right here forever

You'll never have to ask a second time
I'm the one for you, you're the one for me

Float
By Anthony Hamilton

Verse I
Could it be your nice silky tone
Ohh.that makes me want you girl
Distant nights spent love on the phone
As I touch myself / how I want you more
The mood evokes /incense smoke and I'm burning up in temperature / ready to explode
Come take a toke / let's float / baby on higher ground

Chorus
Baby come / float with me

Snuck up behind me and
Jumped on my shopping cart
And rode down, aisle 5
You looked behind you to smile back at me
Crashed into a rack full of magazines
They asked us, if we could leave

Can't remember
What went wrong last September
Though I'm sure you'd remind me
If you had to

Our love was, comfortable and
So broken in

Be understanding

Be wrong or right
Sometimes you've got to sacrifice the things you like
But I was born to try

No point in talking what should have been

Is that same old song that we played along and made my mumma cry

When I got lost in fantasies
In a cartoon land of mysteries
In a place you wont grow old, In a place you wont feel cold
And I'll sing

When all the noises and the shame came calling

But she lied
I said, ""Show me his face again, tell me again why he died""

She said he couldn't wait for the things that I've seen
She said he wasn't strong enough, he never dared to dream a life like mine

My mother had a brother
Over-sensitive and kind
Seems it all became much too much for him
It seems he took his own life

Tears in the dirt, and all over your newborn treasure

Guess he couldn't wait another moment to be free

Smother another failure
Lay this to rest

Console yourself
You're better alone
Destroy yourself

In the good dreams though she wears no clothes

The ocean waits to carry me
Carry me back home again
To where she sleeps I lay my head

Saw her running barefoot
But the ground there never touched her feet
Watched her in the shadows
While the tide came in and claimed our beach
We could've made it in the dunes
We had it all within our reach

And you've got a lot of life to teach

Why do we always have to find our way back home

You can't dress trashy till you spend a lot of money

Funny, but it's still rock and roll to me

Your best bet's a true baby blue continental

Sitting around all day
Who can believe you

Let your mother pray (sugar)

I got a gun the other day from Sako

Verse I
I'm so torn up now/ can't believe I lost you
Lost my best friend/ my soul mate/ can't believe it's true
We've invested in a set of twins/ a small house /and the dog cried out
Knew I was suffering/ he was chained to my pain.

Me and you were meant to last forever
And empty walls can't hold this house together
We were born to live and die together
And now ya gone and I'm so alone

Was her great big feather bed

It was nine feet high and six feet wide
Soft as a downy chick
It was made from the feathers of forty-leven geese
Took a whole bolt of cloth for the tick
It'd hold eight kids and four hound dogs

Kyrie
The wind blows hard against this mountainside
Across the sea into my soul
It reaches into where I cannot hide
Setting my feet upon the road

My heart is old, it holds my memories
My body burns a gem-like flame
Somewhere between the soul and soft machine
Is where I find myself again

Kyrie Eleison down the road that I must travel
Kyrie Eleison through the darkness of the night
Kyrie Eleison where I'm going, will you follow?

Sounds like more Pat Buchanan

Back in his day job this afternoon
Unlikely he'll move down to Cuba soon

Reluctant to find he's stuck in the 90's again

Clem reads of the old days, twenty years goes a long ways
""Challenge the system!"" Relating is easy on a demo...
(Mike)

Now they'll send it by memo

Not knowing knowledge never ennobles

She was a tangle of questions

How many eggs make up a pound?
How many ears of corn in the niblets?

(Jian)
And how big was the bag?

I was a person who would censor ""Pee Wee's Adventure""
She was exceedingly liberal

(Mike, then Jian)

And we fell in love
And the sunshine shone from the sunshine above
Fell in love, whole loaf love

Yes keep your wide eyes wide wide open

But we shouldn't hurt anyone's feelings.
So we tried, and gave up, cuz there was no such song,

What makes a person so poisonous righteous,
That they'd think less of anyone, who just disagrees?
She's just a pacifist, he's just a patriot.
If I said you were crazy, would you have to fight me?

Fighters for liberty,
Fighters for power,
Fighters for longer turns in the shower.

Don't tell me I can't fight 'cause I'll punch out your lights
And history seems to agree

We know from our youth how to be treated
How we'll be received, how we shall end

You can change your clothes
Change your hairstyle, your friends, cities, continents

Always it waits in the wings

Ideas swirl but don't stick
They appear but then run off like rain on the windshield

The atmosphere in this car, a mirror of my skull
Wet, damp, windows dripping and misted with cold
Walls of grey, nothing good on the radio, not a thought in my head

You'll wish you were ten

Like a party bag of lies
Booze and then deceit
And I don't know why
I want to voice this out loud
It's therapeutic somehow

So I'm moving to New York
'Cos I've got problems with my sleep
And we're not the same
And I will wear that on my sleeve
So I'm moving to New York
'Cos I've got issues with my sleep
Looks like Christmas came early

I did something I'll never forget

She had trusted many
But been unfamiliar with
Almost everyone but you

Well, maybe, I'm just thinking
That the rooms are all on fire
Every time that you walk in the room
Well, there is magic all around you
If I do say so myself
I have known this
Much longer than I've known you

And then there would be someone who would enter into her presence
That she could sense for miles

Just a guitar as my companion
Wanting desperately to belong

Fame is filled with spoiled children
They grow fat on fantasy
I guess that's why I'm leaving
I crave reality

Goodbye yellow brick road

I did not find paradise
It was only a reflection of my lonely mind searching
For what was missing in my life

If you want yourself a day man, well I don't mind
You just ditch him when the sun goes down
'Cause the moon shines bright
And everything's all right
When the Wolfman, he creeps into town

Now you maybe want a man who throws round his money
But he ain't as cool as Wolfman Jack

Reclosing his eyes as the doggies retire

The one I'm thinking of
I miss you every day
Please just stay around
You are my beat, my sound
My light, my destiny
You rang the door one early Sunday morning
Said that I was always on your mind
Smiled and said it's meaningless without me
Girl, you're really one of a kind
There was never anyone
Until you just came around
So afraid to be abandoned
Can't afford to lose again
There is no easy love
The one I'm thinking of
I miss you night and day

Miss whatever her name is

Saying silly things that made no sense at all
Tried to sort out the problems

- What?
- Who IS Danger Woman?!

If you've seen it once, you'll see it again
I told everyone and all of my friends
Well there she is and she's at it again
And I think it's all over and now:
(You're gonna get it!)

She's hanging off the chopper
And no one's gonna stop her
Don't try and call the doctor
'Cause she's jumpin' around now
Handle bar standing
And flying over canyons
No hands on the landing
Now we're rollin' around on the ground

-Yes Son?
-Where does dirt come from?
-Dirt comes from: The Worms.
-Wow! Awesome!

There is a chipmunk
At the center of the earth
And in his big oven
He bakes his own desserts
He warms the ocean
And from that, life springs forth
Little organisms building trash around the clock

Compost heaps
Or melting pots
For Farmer John's
Smoked Sausage stocks

Worms make the dirt
And the dirt makes the earth

Sitting at the table, you're biting nails all short

Well as he rips you from your skin

We're all playing for this and in your prayers
Will you believe?
Would you beleive?

You believe, you believe
Just for the first time
You believe, you believe
Just like the last time

A seam away from breaking
You believe, you believe

Many miles between you and me
And love is guaranteed to fail
Cos a fuck should be multi sensory

Going steady, in a secluded spot
I'm leaving nothing to chance

Making out
Its getting better and better

I think i'll take off my sweater

When you've played out As the World Turns
You don't need soaps to clean your mind
Every little child learns
If you can't see dreams, your eyes are blind
Was it just a fool's impression?
Such an antiquated passion.
On the day they both conspired to ride the midway after dark
They had enough of their pride to not bring coins to this amusement park
And she held his hand to follow
And he held his breath, then let go
They crouched down low.
Sat in the front row.
Untied the rope so they could fly
Hold on tight, let's get it just right,
We'll take our last flight. You and I.

(Dave)
I once had a girl, she lived in the past
It was clear that relationship wouldn't last
It was clear from the way she had to sleep south
It was clear from the lines around her mouth
So I went for a walk in the ravine
I came upon an unbelievable scene
In a tiny creek there's a tiny boat
With a tiny man in a tiny coat
I said ""Hey man, do you think you can help?""
He said ""Of course I can - I'm an elf
We're not just fictional device
We sail ravines and give advice""
I said ""My baby is what it's about""
