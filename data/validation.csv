Oh, in Mesopotamia Aloofness ran deep
Deep in the veins of the great rivers
That form the base Of Eden
And the tree The tree of knowledge
Held up its arms To the sky

All the long black funeral cars left the scene
And the boy was just standing there alone
Looking at the shiny red tractor
Him and his daddy used to sit inside
And circle the blue fields and grease the night.
It was if someone had spread butter on all the fine points of the stars
'Cause when he looked up they started to slip.
Then he put his head in the crux of his arm
And he started to drift, drift to the belly of a ship,
Let the ship slide open, and he went inside of it
And saw his daddy 'hind the control board streamin' beads of light,
He saw his daddy 'hind the control board,
And he was very different tonight
'Cause he was not human, he was not human.

And then the little boy's face lit up with such naked joy
That the sun burned around his lids and his eyes were like two suns,
White lids, white opals, seeing everything just a little bit too clearly
And he looked around and there was no black ship in sight,
No black funeral cars, nothing except for him the raven
And fell on his knees and looked up and cried out,
""No, daddy, don't leave me here alone,
Take me up, daddy, to the belly of your ship,
Let the ship slide open and I'll go inside of it
Where you're not human, you are not human.""

But nobody heard the boy's cry of alarm.
Nobody there 'cept for the birds around the New England farm
And they gathered in all directions, like roses they scattered"

I said where I come from
It's cornbread and chicken
Where I come from a lotta front porch sittin'
Where I come from tryin' to make a livin'
And workin' hard to get to heaven
Where I come from
Well i was south of Detroit City
I pulled in this country kitchen
To try their brand of barbecue

On that September day?
Were you in the yard with your wife and children
Or working on some stage in L.A.?
Did you stand there in shock at the site of that black smoke
Rising against that blue sky?
Did you shout out in anger, in fear for your neighbor
Or did you just sit down and cry?

Did you weep for the children who lost their dear loved ones
Pray for the ones who don't know?
Did you rejoice for the people who walked from the rubble
And sob for the ones left below?

Did you burst out in pride, for the red, white and blue
And the heroes who died just doing what they do?
Did you look up to heaven for some kind of answer
And look at yourself and what really matters?

I'm just a singer of simple songs
I'm not a real political man
I watch CNN but I'm not sure I can tell you
The difference in Iraq and Iran
But I know Jesus and I talk to God"

Like you wasn't down and you called him again

A Muslim sleeping with the gin
Now that was the sin that did Jezebel in
Who you gon' tell when the repercussions spin?
Showing off your ass 'cause you thinkin' it's a trend, girlfriend

In light more mundane, thought rattles round my brain
We live, we die... and yet?

In the beginning there was order and destiny
But now that path has reached the border and on our knees
Is no way to face the future, whatever it be
Though the forces which hold us in place
Last through eons in unruffled grace
We too wear the face of creation

As anti-matter sucks and pulses periodically
The bud unfolds, the bloom is dead - All space is living history
It seems as though time must betray us, yet we're alive
And though I see no God to save us, yet we survive

Through the centuries of progress
Which don't get us very far
All illusion! All is bogus

I'll touch your soul and make your brain feel caught
When my rapture traps ya and makes you mine

I got to read a couple books and do some research before I reached my verdict.
Never thought that I was perfect. Always thought that I had a purpose.
Used to wonder if I'd live to see my first kiss.

The most difficult thing I ever did was recite my own words at a service
Realizing the person I was addressing probably wasn't looking down from heaven.
Or cooking up something in hell's kitchen, trying to listen in or eaves drop from some another dimension.
It was self serving just like this is.

Conveniently religious on Easter Sunday and on Christmas.
The television went from being a babysitter to a mistress.
Technology made it easy for us to stay in touch while keeping a distance,
'Til we just stayed distant and never touched. Now all we do is text too much.

I don't remember much from my youth. Maybe my memory is repressed.
Or I just spent too much time wondering if I'd live to have sex.
Fell in love for the first time in 4th grade but I didn't have the courage to talk to her.
In 8th grade I wrote her the note but I slipped it in someone else's locker.

Considered killing myself 'cause of that.
It was a big deal. It was a blown cover.
It was over for me. My goose was cooked.
Stick a fork in me. The jig is up.
I blew my chances, the rest is history, our future was torn asunder.
It became abundantly clear that I was only brought here to suffer.

At least I didn't include my name.
Thankfully I wrote the whole note in code
And it had 10 layers of scotch tape safety seal making it impossible to open.
Plus, it was set to self destruct.
Whoever read it probably died... laughing.
I wonder if they lived long enough to realize what happened.

A year later, I came to understand that wasn't love that I was feeling for her.
I had someone else to obsess over.
I was older. I was very mature.
I forged my time signature while practicing my parents autograph 'cause I was failing math.
Disconnected the phone when I thought the teacher would call my home."

You never could get enough 'cause you know I kept it hot
I listened to you tell me your dreams
And your fears, I wiped your tears
I was there and that's why this is hurting me

Did I give you too much

Get away from all the heartache and pain

Looking at me like I'm just another square saltine
As I get closer I notice that they showing each other sketches
Out of their notebooks, reminded me of my old roots

I walk pass with a nod and a reminisce
Swear to God hip-hop and comic books was my genesis!
Respect the life and the fashions of the children
It's the only culture I've got, exactly what we've been building

All of a sudden I'm in front of some man
No he's a young'in but he's got a gun in his hand
He looks fifteen, he looks frantic, no he looks afraid
Immediately apprehensive 'til I heard him say
""Do you want this? It's not mine, I promise!
I found it on my block in between a couple garages!
Didn't wanna leave it for a child to stumble over!
I don't even know how to hold it!""

It was a thirty-eight, the poor man's machete
Held it in my hand, thinking damn man it's heavier then
Expected,
Wedged it behind my belt buckle
Knowing that it's evil, even thought that I could smell trouble
The extra strength felt weak,
But over there on the corner saw what I needed and proceeded to
Cross the
Street
Put the heat in the mail box to loose it
Figured that the post office knows what's best to do with it

Mosey down the road thinkin' 'bout the old,
I used to roam this zone with two feet of snow
Right here, this used to be a record shop
I've gotten love, I've gotten drunk, I've gotten beat up in that
Parking lot.
I've had my Lake Street pride for three decades
These alleyways, and these streetlights have seen my best days
Before I was a germ learning how to misbehave,
All the way to the grave, South Side is my resting place"

Dictate who I am, and who I want to be
I gave you all my words, and my words are my soul, so
Please try to be kind if you are in control

Time takes, time takes, times takes
Time takes many tears away

If I had some elegance, some airs or grace
Or if I had buttons made of silver
Or tops made of lace
Then I'd be that girl you want
I'd ooze with charm and I'd have
Diamonds on my fingers and you on my arm

You're never cured
If I forgot the lines, is it easy enough to fake it?
Or do you need a moment to rememorize
And model it like a curse half disguised?

Leers, cheers, whispers and the tears
That final taste before you're taken away
Odds, ends, final amends
It's all right to say it
Just as long as you don't really think so

They joined together and decided not to fight

People saw their clairvoyance in the wiped-out elms and harsh sunlight.
Some thought the torture tearing the Lisbon girls pointed to a simple refusal to accept the world as it was handed down to them:
So full of flaws.
But the only thing we are certain of after all these years is the insufficiency of explenation.

""Obviously doctor, you've never been a thirteen year-old girl.""

The Lisbon girls were 13, Cecillia, 14, Lux, 15, Bonnie, 16, Mary, and 17, Therese.
No one could understand how Mrs. Lisbon and Mr. Lisbon, our math teacher, had produced such beautiful creatures.

From that time on, the Lisbon house began to change.
Almost every day, and even when she wasn't keeping an eye on Cecilia,
Lux would suntan on her towel wearing a swimsuit that caused the knife-sharpener to give her a 15-minute demonstration for free.
