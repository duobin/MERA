Journalist: I suddenly noticed the body of a parson, lying on the ground in a ruined churchyard. I felt unable to leave him to the mercy of the Red Weed and I decided to bury him decently.Beth: Nathaniel! Nathaniel!Journalist: The parson's eyes flickered open. He was alive!Beth: Nathaniel! I saw the church burst in to flame! Are you all right?Parson: Don't touch me!Beth: But it's me, Beth, your wife!Parson: No! You're one of them. A devil!Beth: (to Journalist) He's deliriousParson: Lies! I saw the devil's sign.Beth: What are you saying?Parson: The green flash in the sky. His demons were here all along, in our hearts and souls, just waiting for a sign from him. And now they're destroying our world.Beth: But they're not devils, they're Martians.Journalist: We must leave hereBeth: Look! A house is still standing, come Nathaniel, quickly.Journalist: We took shelter in the cottage and black smoke spread, hemming us in. Then a fighting machine came across the fields spraying jets of steam that turned the smoke in to thick, black dust.Martians: Ulla!Beth: Dear God - help us!Parson: The voice of the devil is heard in our land!Parson: Listen, do you hear them drawing nearIn their search for the sinners?Feeding on the power of our fearAnd the evil within us.Incarnation of Satan's creation of all that we dreadWhen the demons arriveThose alive would be better off dead!Beth: There must be something worth living forThere must be something worth trying forEven some things worth dying forAnd if one man could stand tallThere would be hope for us allSomewhere, somewhere in the spirit of manParson: Once there was a time when I believedWithout hesitationThat the power of love and truth could conquer allIn the name of salvationTell me what kind of weapon is love when it comes to the fight?

Hello darkness, my old friendI've come to talk with you againBecause a vision softly creepingLeft its seeds while I was sleepingAnd the vision that was planted in my brainStill remainsWithin the sound of silenceIn restless dreams I walked aloneNarrow streets of cobblestone'Neath the halo of a street lampI turned my collar to the cold and dampWhen my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light

Thinking of poems of povertySitting with a tight clenched wrist, thinking how to gain authorityOh what a soft touch of a boyHe'd wander with pride to sell and keep visions to his selfVisions to his selfWe'd talk of treasures, and over-rated gamesWe'd steal the milk bottles, sneaking through the back round Jimmy's way.What we loved most of all, was sitting round the shop, while this poor boy was sitting all alone,Sitting all alonePondering times of sanctuaryHe was sitting taking his piano lessons, we were on half an EInvested life in medicine, which isn't the wisest way to go, had so much shit going on.Convinced he'd never win. Convinced he was a sin.

He sees what's beneath her skin he sees through her soul.Blue eyes and empty veins her fortune unfolds.She steps out of her body that lies on the floor.Rise, rise from the ashes.Sink teeth into her, she becomes the cure.Blood runs forever, blood runs forever.Full moon illuminates the streets breathing fireThe dead come together to drink their desires.They march down the allies. The devils parade.More of the turbulence that causes disaster.

Way back when I was just a little bitty boyLiving in a box under the stairs in the corner of the basement of the houseHalf a block down the street from Jerry's Bait shopYou know the placeWell, anyway, back then life was going swell and everything was just peachy!Except, of course, for the undeniable fact that every single morningMy mother would make me a big ol' bowl of sauerkraut for breakfastAwww, big bowl of sauerkraut!Every single mornin'!It was driving me crazyI said to my momI said, "Hey, mom, what's up with all the sauerkraut?"And my dear, sweet motherShe just looked at me like a cow looks at an oncoming trainAnd she leaned right down next to meAnd she said, "It's good for you!"And then she tied me to the wall and stuck a funnel in my mouthAnd force fed me nothing but sauerkraut until I was twenty six and a half years oldThat's when I swore that somedaySomeday I would get outta that basement and travel to a magical, far away placeWhere the sun is always shining and the air smells like warm root beerAnd the towels are oh so fluffyWhere the shriners and the lepers play their ukuleles all day longAnd anyone on the street will gladly shave your back for a nickelWacka wacka doodoo yeah!Well, let me tell you, people, it wasn't long at all before my dream came trueBecause the very next day, a local radio station had this contestTo see who could correctly guess the number of molecules in Leonard Nimoy's buttI was off by three, but I still won the grand prizeThat's right, a first class one-way ticket toAlbuquerqueAlbuquerqueOh yeahYou know, I'd never been on a real airplane beforeAnd I gotta tell ya, it was really greatExcept that I had to sit between two large Albanian women with excruciatingly severe body odorAnd the little kid in back of me kept throwin' up the whole timeThe flight attendants ran out of Dr. Pepper and salted peanutsAnd the in-flight movie was with Pauly ShoreAnd, oh yeah, three of the airplane engines burned outAnd we went into a tailspin and crashed into a hillsideAnd the plane exploded in a giant fireball and everybody diedExcept for meYou know why?'Cause I had my tray table upAnd my seat back in the full upright positionHad my tray table upAnd my seat back in the full upright positionHad my tray table upAnd my seat back in the full upright positionAh ha ha haAh ha haAhhhhSo I crawled from the twisted, burnin' wreckageI crawled on my hands and knees for three full daysDraggin' along my big leather suitcase and my garment bagAnd my tenor saxophone and my twelve-pound bowling ballAnd my lucky, lucky autographed glow-in-the-dark snorkelBut finally I arrived at the world famous Albuquerque Holiday InnWhere the towels are oh so fluffyAnd you can eat your soup right out of the ashtrays if you wannaIt's okay, they're clean!Well, I checked into my room and I turned down the A/CAnd I turned on the SpectraVisionAnd I'm just about to eat that little chocolate mint on my pillowThat I love so very, very much when suddenly, there's a knock on the doorWell now, who could that be?I say, "Who is it?"No answer"Who is it?"There's no answer"WHO IS IT?"
Would you love a monsterman?Could you understand?Beauty of the beast.Fire at will, will, will, willFire at willYeah I would killYeah I would freeze all hell all overJust to get a chill.Yeah I would slay, yeah I would maimYeah I would vanish in thin airAnd reappear again.Be right in the squaresYeah, I would be sincere.Yeah, I would lie, yeah, I would lie.Yeah, I would be there waking up the dead to get a thrillI say "Yeah", I say "Yeah".
Staring at a maple leafLeaning on the mother treeI said to myself, "We all lost touch"Your favorite fruit is chocolate covered cherriesAnd seedless watermelon, ohNothing from the ground is good enoughBody riseIt puts over meOh chariot, your golden wavesAre walking down upon this faceOh chariot, I'm singing out loudTo guide meGive me yourStrengthRemember seeking moons rebirthRains made mirrors of the earthThe sun was just yellow energyIt is a living promise land
You're falling through the nightAnd giving in to bad dreamsWhere nothing is as it seemsThere's still a long way to goAnd the fading glorious nightNever seems to bring you homeYou think that this is your roadThere's still a long way to goI can't give you an A to ZThere's some things I just can't show
Big orange ball, sinkin' in the waterToes in the sand couldn't get much hotterLittle umbrella shaped margaritasCoconut oil, tan and señoritasOh, now I know how Jimmy Buffet feelsHands on the wheel, cruisin' down the interstateGas, pedal sticks carries my car awayI was going as fast as a rambler goesI could feel the speed from my head to my toes
So many nights, I'd sit by my windowWaiting for someone to sing me her songSo many dreams, I kept deep inside meAlone in the dark, but now you've come alongAnd you light up my lifeYou give me hope to carry onYou light up my daysAnd fill my nights with song

The child without a name grew up to be the handTo watch you, to shield you or kill on demandThe choice he'd made, he could not comprehendHis blood a grim secret they had to commandHe's torn between his honor and the true love of his lifeHe prayed for both, but was deniedSo many dreams were broken and so much was sacrificedWas it worth the ones we loved and had to leave behind?So many years have past, who are the noble and the wise?Will all our sins be justified?

I hear the drizzle of the rainLike a memory it fallsSoft and warm, continuingTapping on my roof and wallsAnd from the shelter of my mindThrough the window of my eyesI gaze beyond the rain-drenched streetsTo England, where my heart lies
Through the corridors of sleepPast the shadows dark and deepMy mind dances and leaps in confusionI don't know what is realI can't touch what I feelAnd I hide behind the shield of my illusionSo I'll continue to continue to pretendThat my life will never endAnd the flowers never bendWith the rainfall
Oh, the night sets softlyWith the hush of falling leavesCasting shivering shadowsOn the houses through the treesAnd the light from a street lampPaints a pattern on my wallLike the pieces of a puzzleOr a child's uneven scrawlUp a narrow flight of stairsIn a narrow little roomAs I lie upon my bed

- The mckenzie brothers just reached their limits. it's now mid-august and two months have passed since the new marshall mike monroe came to town. he'd already put joe and jeramiha six feet under.They were drunk as the skunks, they were on their way back from the saloon. they passed steve harlow's range to wrestle some cattle. the marshall and his deputies showed up and shot 'em in the neck. the most bloody fireworks dog head city had ever seen. jim, the oldest brother and head of the clan since father judas got his head blown of in a gunfight, saddled up his horse and went in to town, just to set things straight with the marshall. on his way to town he rode past his uncle jock's to fill him in about joe and jeramiha."Looks like the marshall wants a war and he's gonna get one", jock said. "i'll send a message out for brother james, your uncle. remember him? you met at the wedding when he stole your cousin julia from the groom." meanwhile, in town, marshall monroe and his deputies were drinking their heads off and shootin' run away chickens to celebrate the passing of the mckenzies.Next morning, the mckenzie clan were ready to set things straight with the marshall and his men. they sent little john into town to lure 'em out and into a trap, so they can shoot 'em dead.John came to town, walked into the saloon, saw the marshall eatin' lunch. baked beans, sollie belly and a tun of brew. he saw his chance to be a man, he'd always been a little boy in the clan. he wiped his sweat of his hands and said: "hey scumbag, this town ain't big enough for the two of us. you killed my two brothers and now, it's your time to kiss the dust. get ready to slap leather."But before john even cleared his holster, the marshall had filled him with so much lead, it took six strong men to carry him out. mike monroe finished his meal, reloaded his gun, gathered his men and said: "it's time to finish the mckenzies, once and for all."The mckenzie brothersMay hell be your homeThe mckenzie brothersThe end of your terrordomeThe mckenzie brothersMay hell be your homeThe mckenzie brothersThe end of your terrordomeAfter the final battle,

Underneath the shelfCracks appear in thinking I'm aloneIn this life'sExcuse for wasting timeI wait for signals shooting starsI scrape through every branchCause I need to come downUnderneath the homeI lived in I was a page in someone's bookAnd no-one asked me whyThe page was fifteen stories highI'm underneath that homeAnd wondering whyOoh Ooh
Every time I think of youI feel shot right through with a bolt of blueIt's no problem of mineBut it's a problem I findLiving a life that I can't leave behindBut there's no sense in telling meThe wisdom of the fool won't set you freeBut that's the way that it goesAnd it's what nobody knowsWell every day my confusion growsEvery time I see you fallingI get down on my knees and prayI'm waiting for that final moment
I stood there beside myselfThinking hard about the weatherThey came by a friend of mineSuggested we go out togetherThen I knew it from the startThis friend of mine would fall apartPretending not to see his guiltI said "Let's go out and have some fun"
How does it feelTo treat me like you do?When you've laid your hands upon meAnd told me who you are?Thought I was mistakenI thought I heard your wordsTell me, how do I feel?Tell me now, how do I feel?Those who came before meLived through their vocations
YeahA devil in a midnight massHe prayed behind stained glassA memory of Sunday classResurrected from the pastHold your breath and count to fourPinky swears don't work no moreFootsteps down the hallway floorGetting closer to my doorI was alive, but now I'm singing(Silent night) For the rest of my life(Silent night) For the rest of my life(Violent knight) At the edge of your knife("Forgive me Father") Won't make it right(Silent night) For the rest of my life

Our final conversationIt lies heavy on my mindAnd although we couldn't say itI think we know, we can't go back this timeNo love and desperationIs there writing on the wall?And will all the lights stop flashing?Or is this the final curtain call?It's such a shame, it's such a shameDon't walk away, don't walk awayAll this time I thought I knew myselfBut once again, I bury my head in shameNothing lasts foreverA flower always dies
When a man loves a womanCan't keep his mind on nothin' elseHe'd trade the worldFor the good thing he's foundIf she is bad, he can't see itShe can do no wrongTurn his back on his best friendIf he put her downWhen a man loves a womanSpend his very last dimeTryin' to hold on to what he needs
Oh, well, I was born in alittle bitty tar hutAnd they called me a man 'cause I couldn'tKeep my big, big mouth shutSo what's the sense of me sitting here leavingWhen any ole day I might be evenAnd Lord knows that New York City's gotA lot to do with itI wish someday I could find the wayTo get it out of my grainThis dirty old town's gonna sink right downAnd I don't want to go with itWell I wish there was a way thatI knew to get evenA way to get a lick inA 'bobbin' and a 'weavin'Any ole thing besides goin' and a'leavin'You can do on a trainWell, I once knew a man who sailed around
What you don't knowIs that your scars are beautifulWhat you don't knowIs your imperfections are what make me wholeWhat you don't knowIs how I spiral downCause I can't speak whenever you're aroundAnd it's not like me to hide behind a wallAnd it's not like me to fear the fallWhat you don't knowIs that I lay awakeWishing you were here tonightWhat you don't knowThat I loved you long before we were aliveCause how would you know, how could you knowSo now I'm gonna tell you everything
Everything I do I do to be with youEverything I do I do to be with youI do to be with you, I do to be with youTake a look around, take a look at meAnd tell me what you see, am I just a friend'Cause if I am, I wanna be more it's trueAnything you want, anything you needI can give to you, if you let me in yeaMy heart is open wide, for you to come insideAnd make yourself at homeNo mountain'd be too high for me to climbAs long as you were on the other sideEverything I do I do to be with youAn' nothing in this world could ever beMore than you already are to meEverything I do I do to be with you
See it in your eyesFeel it in my headFeeding me your painFalling out againSmall strong blowSmall strong blowSee it in your eyesFeel it in my headFeeding me your painFalling out againSmall strong blowSmall strong blowDone the same old route before
What is there to sayWhen all the love has slipped awayIn half a minuteThere is always something we can blameBut in the end, it's just the sameSuddenly, you find yourself alone
I thought that I was over youHow I was mistakenWhy did I bump into youAnd start this chain reaction, mmI felt it building up insideWhen suddenlyOh, it was more than I can bearMm, more than I can bearWhen I saw youWalking down the road with someone newI couldn't believe it was trueIt was true, yeahI find it hard to sleep at nightThis jealousy is burning brightVisions of somebody elseTorments me to distraction, oh yeah
A-Get upA-Get upGet outta your lazy bed.Before I count to three - step to it baby.She goes out every night 'till the mornings lightAnd she sleeps all day.So come on and get upI won't say it again - I'll drag you out!(Skat singing)Dah Do AahDah Dah Dah Doobie Do DahDa doobie doobie doobie doobie doobie doobie Do DahDah Dah Dah Doobie Do DahA-Get upA- Get upGet out of your lazy bed. . . .I don't care anymore.
'Cause I won'tTake what I giveI've sworn I'mBetter withinNot the last timeIt keeps coming backBuilding knowledgeGaining strengthA part of the JekyllA part of the HydeFear itself is biggerThan the seedIt bares resemblanceTo the mouths that I feedI'm sworn to a great divideSworn to a great divideHow will I turnWhen it beckons to me?Can I turn myself from home?Well, it's time to decideIs that really the key
A little past suppertimeI'm still out on the porch step sitting on my behindWaiting for youWondering if everything is alrightMomma said, "Come in boy,Don't waste your time." I said, "I've got timeWell, he'll be here soon."Five years old and talking to myselfWhere were you? Where'd you go?Daddy, can't you tell?I'm not trying to fake itAnd I ain't the one to blameNo, there's no one homeIn my house of painI didn't write these pagesAnd my script's been rearrangedNo, there's no one homeIn my house of painNo, there's no one home
Listen Isa, don't you cryI can tell you've seen a fightAll that's hurt is just your prideIt's not a matter of which side I'm onAnd not for all the bottlesOr the million dollarsWould I ever trade my fire?
I want you to know, that I'm happy for youI wish nothing but the best for you bothAn older version of meIs she perverted like meWould she go down on you in a theatreDoes she speak eloquentlyAnd would she have your babyI'm sure she'd make a really excellent mother'Cause the love that you gave that we made wasn't ableTo make it enough for you to be open wide, noAnd every time you speak her nameDoes she know how you told me you'd hold meUntil you died, till you diedBut you're still aliveAnd I'm here to remind youOf the mess you left when you went away
You abandoned meLove don't live here anymoreJust a vacancyLove don't live here anymoreWhen you lived inside of meThere was nothing I could conceiveThat you wouldn't do for meTrouble seemed so far awayYou changed that right away, babyYou abandoned meLove don't live here anymoreJust a vacancyLove don't live here anymoreLove don't live here anymore
I see you shivering from the coldYou slip in front of me, in the queueThe people behind us staringYou get the privilege of being with meLike I get the poetry in motion of your body next to mineI believe in the way that you moveI believe in the way that you moveMy mind is in the gutter
Don't let your mind get weary and confusedYour will be still, don't try...Don't let your heart get heavyChild, inside you, there's a strength that liesDon't let your soul get lonelyChild, it's only time, it will go byDon't look for love in faces, places
Three more daysGirl you know I will be coming home to ya darlingThree more daysGirl you know I will be coming home to ya darlingI know it's wrong to be so far from homeI know it's wrong to leave you so aloneI've just got to getcha this good job doneSo I can bring it on home to youSo I can bring it on home to youThree more daysGirl you know I will be right there by your side, baby
Well the truth it fell so heavyLike a hammer through the roomThat I could choose another over herYou always said I was an actor, babyGuess in truth you thought me just amateurThat you never saw the signsThat you never lost your gripOh come on nowThat's such a childish claimNow I wear the brand of traitorDon't it seem a bit absurdWhen it's clear I was so obviously framedWhen it's clear I was so obviously framed
I gave me awayI could have knocked off the eveningBut I lonelily landed my waltz in her handsIn a way I felt you were leaving meI was sure I wouldn't find you at homeAnd you let me downCould have knocked off the eveningBut you lonelily let him push under your boneYou let me downIt's no use deceivingNeither of us wanna be aloneYou're coming home (x 4)I gave me awayI could have knocked off the eveningBut I was lonelily looking for someone to holdIn a way I lost all I believed in
Don't look for compassionAs long as youKeep turning awayIt's all that matters to meWhen I try to puzzle your painYou struggle against yourselfBy living in the dustCan't you realizeThere's no one hereWho you can't trustMay the gods have mercyOn your bastard brainHold on one more secondMy fatal oneFeeding angels with despairFlameouts reigning everywhereAnd you need it soYou just can't let it go awayI try hard to pull theStrings of your lifeAdopting my soulTo figure out what's rightDeep down I knowYou can make it shine
Hey soilmates, we're facing the endWe're down low no use to pretendA bitter message from heaven sentIt says we're asleep at the wheel againLet's say we're stuck in an illusionLet's say we're out of controlPossessed by a lethal redeemerForcing us to play a neurotic roleOh, won't you take this thing out of meIt never leaves me aloneFight the demons and devastateThis mental battlezoneBring it back, bring it homeEnough is enough, I'm aloneEverything's set all ready to go awayBring it back, bring it homeTo the place I used to knowThere comes a timeWhen this nighmare will turn to hate
To the centre of the city where all roads meet, waiting for youTo the depths of the ocean where all hopes sank, searching for youI was moving through the silence without motion, waiting for youIn a room with a window in the corner I found truth
A change of speed, a change of styleA change of scene, with no regretsA chance to watch, admire the distanceStill occupied, though you forgetDifferent colours, different shadesOver each mistakes were madeI took the blame
Radio, live transmissionRadio, live transmissionListen to the silence, let it ring onEyes, dark grey lenses frightened of the sunWe would have a fine time living in the nightLeft to blind destructionTake away our sightAnd we would go on as though nothing was wrongAnd hide from these days we remained all aloneStaying in the same place, just staying out the time
Yeah I got bustedSo I used my one phone callTo dedicateA song to you on the radioYeah I got bustedIn custodyI imagined our melodyBeing played on a grand pianoI saw your face in front of meIt was perfect clarityI saw a light in the end of the tunnelAnd it was youChorus:Cause you are the light by which I travel into this and that
A man walks into a barOrders a beer and a bowl of peanutsBut the bar turns into a spaceshipAnd the bartender gives him a hair cutI cant remember the end of that jokeYou once told it to me when we smokedOn your father's expensive cigarsAll i remember is the part of a man walking into a barHow many lovers does it takeTo put a light bulb into a socket?Why did Mona Lisa smile?I have the answer written down in my pocket.I just remember I laughed till i cried

Cause her last relationship fucked her up.Got hurt majorly, finds it tough to trust.Looked at the ashtray, then looked back up,Spinning it away on the tabletop.She looked much fitter than Saturday just.She worked in JD's with dan.Back then I figured she was pretty damn rough,But she was only wearing her work stuff.And in these clothes she looked more than buff,She stirred her straw, sat up to adjust.I told her I thought it was important,That you could get lost in conversation.Chattin shit, sittin in, oblivionWith that person who's your special one.She said she was the worst pool player under the sun,But blokes go easy so she always won.I saw this thing on ITV the other week,Said, that if she played with her hair, she's probably keenShe's playing with her hair, well regularly,So I reckon I could well be in.She didn't look too bored with what I was saying.Her hair looked much better than the other day.She had her fingers 'round her hair, playin'.I Saw on the telly that's a good indication.She didn't offer to buy the next drink though, "Nay."Suppose that's just our girl's way.I'm trying to think what else I could say,Peelin' the label off, spinning the ashtray.Yeah actually, yes, she did look pretty neat.

Is it sensible, life is what it seemsWhen you're living in a dreamCould you care enough? While pausing on a thoughtCan you think of what you've got?(Only you know what matters in your life)When it's pouring out, you're pondering insideAnd all the times you shouted, everybody criedYou've got to learn to compromiseTo live inside the others' livesIt's not peculiar, there's nothing to devise at all

After we spoke I had a dream that I brokeThe teeth from a mouth of a snakeThen I choked on the teethThey were mine all alongI picked up the pieces when I wokePut them in a boat made of things that I don't want to seeI blew on the sailWatched it drift out to seaThe further it drifted the closer it came to meI can't explainSo I took it apart in a billion boxes
If I had eyes in the back of my headI would've told you that you looked good as I walked awayAnd if you could've tried to trust the hand that fedYou would've never been hungry, but you'd never really beMore of this or less of this or is there any difference?Or are we just holding on to things that we don't have anymore?Sometimes time doesn't healNo, not at allIt just stands stillWhile we fallIn or out of love, again I doubtI'm gonna win you back
If you could read my mindYou'd say baby you were rightAnd I don't wanna fight anymoreYou're usually righter than I amAnd I'm not a very good fighterAm I? No, neither are youSo let's be through with this oneCause some things never changeI know you're still my same girlWho builds her own frames

Your voice is adriftI can't expect it to sing to meAs if I was the only oneI'll follow youThe leaf that's following the sunWhen will my weight be too much for you?When will these ideas really be my own?Cause this moment keeps on movingWe were never meant to hold on
In my rear viewI watch you watching the twilightBehind the telephone linesWith nothing to prove,Or to assumeJust thinking that your thoughtsAre different than mineIn my rear viewI watch youAnd I gave you your lifeBut you give me mineI see you slowly swim awayAs the light is leaving townTo a place that I can't beBut there's no apologiesJust go onJust go onThere're still so many thingsI want to say to you

Un adiós se llevoLos años más felices de mi vidaDejándome el alma triste y fríaVolviendo a la soledadY a pensar como estarásNo te puedo olvidarTu ausencia es algo que me tiene heridaLa noche es larga y mi cuerpo extrañaEl amarte otra vezComo ya lo hice ayerHoy sin tiEmpiezo a recordarteEmpiezo a lamentarmeComo ya lo hice ayer

Just a day, just an ordinary dayJust trying to get byJust a boy, just an ordinary boy, butHe was looking to the sky andAs he asked, if I would come alongI started to realizeThat everyday he finds, just what he's lookin' forLike a shooting star, he shinesAnd he said...Take my hand, live while you canDon't you see your dreams lieRight in the palm of your hand?And as he spoke, he spoke ordinary wordsAlthough, they did not feel, noFor I felt what I had not felt beforeAnd you'd swear those words could heal, and
She'd do anything to sparkle in his eyesShe would suffer, she would fight and compromiseShe's been wishin' up the stars that shine so brightFor answers to questions that will haunt her tonightShe must rinseThis all awayShe can't hold him this wayShe must rinseThis all awayShe can't love himThis wayHow she'd be soothed, how she'd be saved, if he could seeShe needs to be held in his arms to be freedBut everything happens for reasons that she will never understand'Til she knows that the heart of a woman
My heart, your hands, gentle my friendBreak me neatly, numb me sweetlySay you would, say you couldSay you'd come and stop the rainSay you'd try and hold me tightAnd you just give me awayMake me high on lullabiesA melody for me to swaySay you would, say you couldAnd you don't do anythingCome down heavy, try and steadyPrecious ladies, love you, love meSay you would, say you could
I see a red door and I want it painted blackNo colors anymore, I want them to turn blackI see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothesI have to turn my head until my darkness goesI see a line of cars and they are painted blackWith flowers and my love both never to come backI see people turn their heads, and quickly look awayLike a new born baby it just happens every day

You've left me with nothing left but questionsYou left me here not knowing who I amYou've left me so much fucking time to hate youYou left me with no choice but to dieViolent mood swingsViolent mood swingsViolent mood swingsViolent mood swingsViolent mood swingsViolent mood swingsYour voice whispers nearly all the time nowReminding me just how worthless I am

You've been missin'Out on all the chances you've been givenIs it something withinHolding you back instead of livin'Your day is coming though it seems farThings will be clear when you love who you areNothin' can stop you as long as you listen to your heartLift your head to the sky and keep tryin'Believe in you and it will take you higherLift your head to the sky and keep tryin'Believe in you and it will take you higherYou have sorrows
Don't look so sadI know it's overBut life goes onAnd this old world will keep on turningLet's just be gladWe had some time to spend togetherThere's no need to watch the bridgesThat we're burningLay your head upon my pillowHold your warm and tender body close to mine
I said the night you left me,Nothin' worse could ever happen,But seeing you with someone else proved that I was wrong.And when your eyes met mine,I knew that you were gone forever,Along with all the reasons, I had for hanging on.I'd be better off in a pine box,On a slow train back to Georgia,Or in the grey walls of a prison doing time.I think I'd rather die,And go to hell and face the devil,Than to lie here with you and him together on my mind.
I never thought that I couldCrush upon your sandy shoresLike the feeling of your warm securityIt's not like meNow I come with strange excitementAt your very touch I'm frightenedDon't I ask too much you tell me'Long as I can keep on yellingDon't don't tell me noI want you to take my hand

I took a walk in the rain one day on the wrong side of the tracksI stood on the rail 'till I saw that train just to see how my heart would reactNow some people say that you shouldn't tempt fate and for them I can not disagreeBut I never learned nothing from playing it safeI say fate should not tempt meI take my chancesI don't mind working without a netI take my chancesI take my chances every chance I getI sat alone in the dark one night, tuning in by remote

When the truth is found to be liesAnd all the joy within you diesDon't you want somebody to love?Don't you need somebody to love?Wouldn't you love somebody to love?You better find somebody to loveTears are running down your dress
We had the right love at the wrong timeGuess I always knew inside,I wouldn't have you for a long timeThose dreams of yoursAre shining on distant shoresAnd if they're calling you awayI have no right to make you stayBut somewhere down the roadOur roads are gonna cross againIt doesn't really matter whenBut somewhere down the roadI know that heart of yours will come to see
A little white picket fence around your heartIt's everything you wantedNow it's tearing you apartYou're gonna raise a family nowBut you don't know where to startI remember youMe I pack a suitcaseAnd move from town to townA little east of EdenToo late to turn aroundMarionettes on wiresYou dance out of controlI remember youAre you crying in your sleep tonightWhen you're lying with himDo you turn out the lightAre you hiding in your dreams tonightIn your worldI will be the ghost in your heartThe ghost in your heart
I've all my wisdom teethTwo up top, two beneathAnd yet I'll recognizeMy mouth says things that aren't so wiseBut when I sing my darling's praiseI know I'm right or close anywaysFor she's a gem upon this earthI know to me she will returnOh, I know it's true, I know it's trueThat I was made for her and she me tooAnd I'm confident that she'll think so tooAnd she'll be come back, come back, come backCome back, come back soonMornings we have toast and teaI gaze across the table, she glares right back at meAnd when we're getting low on jamI give her the last spoonful, that's just the way I am

I've been trying for hours just to think of what exactly to sayI thought I'd leave you with a letter or a fiery speechLike when an actor makes an exit at the end of a playAnd I've been dying for hoursTrying to fill up all the holes with some senseI'd like to know why you gave up and you threw it awayI'd like to give you all the reasons and what everything meantWell I could tell you goodbye or maybe see you aroundWith just the touch of a sarcastic thanksWe started out with a bang and at the top of the worldNow the guns are exhausted and the bullets are blanksAnd everything's blankIf I could only find the words then I would write it all downIf I could only find a voice I would speakOh, it's there in my eyes, oh, can't you see me tonight?C'mon and look at me and read 'em and weepIf I could only find the words then I would write it all downIf I could only find a voice I would speakOh, it's there in my eyes, oh, can't you see me tonight?Come on and look at me and read 'em and weepI've been whispering softly, trying to build a cry up into a screamWe let the past slip away and put the future on hold
Llámame loco, loco soy felizSi no fuera por eso no estaría aquíNunca me rendí a pesar de todoCuando empece estaba tan soloNunca me aceptaron hasta que el niño crecióY dejo de ser tan maloYa no llegaban los disparosFaltaban agallas en esas manosConocí a mis hermanosLos primeros que me apoyaronEsa familia nunca sera pasadoEstán presentes en cada pasoEn mis gloria y y fracasosLes debo todo ellos me enseñaron el valorA como exterminar el miedo siendo solo yoPor eso hoy les canto esta canciónManteniendo viva aquella ilusión
If you don't know me by nowYou will never never never know meAll the things that we've been throughYou should understand me like I understand youNow girl I know the difference between right and wrongI ain't gonna do nothing to break up our happy homeOh don't get so excited when I come home a little late at night'Cause we only act like children when we argue fuss and fight
Love me down easy and then say goodbyeLove me down easy and I'll try not to cryEven if it means I have to wait until my next lifeI don't care it's just something to doLike the petals of five dozen roses with white chocolateAnd champagne in bed that's how I think of you'Cause you're sweeter than the taste of a cherry so rareWhen you love me, love me, love me down easyLove me down easy and then savor each kiss

I would rather suffer sweet silent solitudeDeathly defiant from drowning outFilthy sounds stumbling, ugly and cruelBetween the lips of your beautiful mouthDeep down within me words move in phasesFrozen and still until they decideTo melt and drip over the pagesUntil that moment they live inside.
Gun fire in the street where we used to meetEchoes out a beat and the bass goesBomb right over my head, step over the deadRemember what you said, you know, the part aboutLife is just a waking dream, well I know what you meanBut that ain't how it seems right here right nowHow can this be real, I can barely feel anymore
I let you put it in my mouthI let it get under my skinI let you pump it through my ... veinsI let you take me from withinThey tell us what we can and can not doSame thing we've heard a hundred times beforeThe way I put you inside of meNone of that matters anymoreMy god can we go any fasterOh my god I don't think I can last here
They're starting to open up the skyThey're starting to reach down throughAnd it feels like we're living in that split-secondOf a car crashAnd time is slowing downAnd if we only had a little more timeAnd this timeIs all there isDo you remember the time weAnd all the times weAnd should haveAnd were going toI knowAnd I know you rememberHow we could justify it allAnd we knew betterIn our hearts we knew betterAnd we told ourselves it didn't matter

If we're the flagship of peace and prosperityWe're taking on water and about to fuckin' sinkNo one seems to notice, no one even blinksThe crew left the passengers to die under the seaCountdown to the very endEquality, an invitation that we wont extendReady aim, pull the trigger nowIts time you firmly secure your place in hell
Suffering from something we're not sure ofIn a world there is no cure forThese lives we live test negative for happinessFlat line, no pulse but eyes openSingle file like soldiers on a missionIf there's no war outside our headsWhy are we losin'?I don't ask for muchTruth be told I'd settleFor a life less frighteningA life less frighteningI don't ask for muchTruth be told I'd settleFor a life less frighteningA life less frighteningHang me out to dry, I'm soakin'
One last thing I beg you pleaseJust before you goI've watched you fly on paper wingsHalfway around the world until theyBurned up in the atmosphereAnd sent you spiraling downLanding somewhere far from here with no one else aroundTo catch you falling downAnd I'm looking at you nowAnd I can't tell if you're laughingBetween each smile there's a tear in your eyeThere's a train leaving town in an hourIt's not waiting for you and neither am I
This place rings with echoes ofLives once lived, but now are lostTime spent wondering about tomorrowI don't care if we lose it all tonightUp in flames, burning brightWarming the air of the world"I don't love you anymore" is all I remember you telling meNever have I felt so coldBut I've no more blood to bleed'Cause my heart has been draining into the seaSteps, I take in your footstepsAre getting me closer to what is left
Are we so aloneSo distantSo forgottenAs we think ourselves to be?These are our livesBut did they ever even matter?Are we worth remembering?These machines feed on the tears of broken lives and dying dreamsWe're throwing wrenches in the gearsOur lives will not be lived in vainWhen this is all said and doneWe spent this life on the runJudged by the company we keepOur language, buried inside
We're losing daylight but I can't work any fasterUnder the veil of dusk we go onDon't close your eyesWhat if it all disappears in the shadowsThat reach from the stars?If I held my ground would you ask me to change?This drought bleeds on, and we're dancing for rainDrink the air, but it's still not the sameThese worlds collide, but the distance remainsWe point the finger, never accept the blame, and I knowAnd I know, let's go
Am I loud and clear, or am I breaking up?Am I still your charm, or am I just bad luck?Are we getting closer, or are we just getting more lost?I'll show you mine if you show me yours firstLet's compare scars, I'll tell you whose is worseLet's unwrite these pages and replace them with our own wordsWe live on front porches and swing life awayWe get by just fine here on minimum wageIf love is a labor I'll slave till the endI won't cross these streets until you hold my hand
One more step and I could fall awayIf it happened would it matterAnd I can't tell if I should go or staySame old picture feel so hollowHow can anybody know what's best for meAnother page I turn in shameAnd my decisions brought me to my kneesI needed someone to blame

She went off to the cityTo find what she was looking forTo identify, to really tryTo find herself some hopeWith the summer sun for laughingAnd the winter rain did pourShe was lovelier from learningAnd from living, loving moreFrom her dancing love and young soulAnd the gypsies in her dreamTo the pulse of stark acceptance
It was more like a dream than realityI must have thought it was a dream while she was here with meWhen she was near I didn't think she would leaveWhen she was gone it was too much to believeSo with tomorrow I will borrow
Don't you come downDon't you feel badEven though your dreams are ofThe things you've never hadClose to the earthNear to the sunReflecting your own lifeYou can see that youCan be more than one
With all the legends that the century singsAnd it's vision bring to lifeWhile foreign waters breathe against the shoreAnd the wind plays ore it's rusted fifeI see the ships of a friendly fleetAnd a song so sweetly soundingAnd gentle souls who think not to defeatAs across the waves they are bounding
Blackbird was in the field and the sun was getting dimThe breeze running through the trees like an organ in a hymnThoughts were suspended like a leaf out on a limbFire was burning low and the winter coming in

How many roads must a man walk downBefore you call him a man?How many seas must the white dove sailBefore she sleeps in the sand?How many times must the cannonballs flyBefore they're forever banned?The answer, my friend, is blowing in the windThe answer is blowing in the windHow many years can a mountain exist

Watching all the insects march alongSeem to know just right where they belongSmears a face reflecting in the chromeHiding in the crowd, I'm all aloneNo one's heard a single word I've saidThey don't sound this good outside my headIt looks as though the past is here to stayI've become a million miles aWhy do you get all the love in the world?Why do you get all the love in the world?All the jagged edges disappearColors all look brighter when you're nearThe stars are all afire in the sky
I tried to stick myself throughTry to get to the other sideI had to patch up the cracksAnd the holes that i had to hideFor a little bit of time even made it work, okayJust long enough to really make it hurtThen you figured me outAnd it all just rotted awayDon't you fucking know what you are?Don't you fucking know what you are?Don't you fucking know what you are?(Go on, get back to where you belong)You better take a good look'Cause I'm full of shitWith every bit of my heart
I pick things upI am a collectorAnd things, well things they tend to accumulateI have this netIt drags behind meIt picks up feelings for me to feed uponThere are times, plenty of times I wish I could let it goBut they start to breatheAnd they start to grow inside meThere are times, plenty of times I wish I could let it goBut they start to make me thinkThings I don't wanna knowI'm trying to fit it all insideI'm trying to open my mouth wideI'm trying not to choke andSwallow it allSwallow it all
I believe I can see the future'Cause I repeat the same routineI think I used to have a purposeThen again, that might have been a dreamI think I used to have a voiceNow I never make a soundAnd I just do what I've been toldI really don't want them to come around, oh noEvery day is exactly the sameEvery day is exactly the sameThere is no love here and there is no painEvery day is exactly the sameI can feel their eyes are watching
I'm becoming less definedAs days go byFading awayWell you might sayI'm losing focusKinda drifting into the abstractIn terms of how I see myselfSometimes I think I can see right through myselfSometimes I think I can see right through myselfI think sometimes I can see right through myselfLess concernedAbout fitting into the worldYour world that is'Cause it doesn't really matterNo it doesn't really matterNo it doesn't really matter any moreNone of this really matters any moreYes, I am aloneBut then again I always wasAs far back as I can tellI think maybe it's becauseBecause you were never really realTo begin with
Getting a little erratic hereAnd I don't know who to trustI guess they got a way of reading my mindI guess I gotta adjustGot my arms they flip flop flip flop flipGot my head on a springWell I thought I got you on my sideI haven't got fucking anythingI'm just a face in the crowdNothing to worry aboutNot even tryin' to stand outI'm getting smaller and smaller and smallerAnd I have nothing to sayIt's all been taken awayI just behave and obeyI'm afraid I am starting to fade awayUh-huh
Sunspots cast a glare in my eyesSometimes i forget I'm aliveI feel it coming and I've gotta get out of it's wayI hear it calling and I come cause I can't disobeyI should not listen and I shouldn't believe but I doYes I doShe turns me onShe makes it realI have to apologizeFor the way I feelMy life it seems has taken a turnWhy in the name of god would i ever want to return
There are things that I said I would never doThere are fears that I cannot believe have come trueFor my soul is too sick and too little and too lateAnd myself, I have grown too weary to hateThe more I stay in hereThe more it's not so clearThe more I stay in hereThe more I disappearAs far as I have gone
I am all alone this time aroundSometimes on the side I hear a soundPlaces parallel I know it's youFeel the little pieces bleeding throughAnd all this goes onAnd on and on and on and on and on and on and onThis goes on
See the animal in his cage that you builtAre you sure what side you're on?Better not look him too closely in the eyeAre you sure what side ofThe glass you are on?See the safety of the life you have builtEverything where it belongsFeel the hollowness inside of your heartAnd it's allRight where it belongsWhat if everything around youIsn't quite as it seems?What if all the world you think you know
Angie, AngieWhen will those clouds all disappear?Angie, AngieWhere will it lead us from here?With no loving in our soulsAnd no money in our coatsYou can't say we're satisfiedAngie, AngieYou can't say we never triedAngie, you're beautiful, yeahBut ain't it time we said goodbye?

I remember when I found out about chemistry,It was a long, long way from here,I was old enough to want it,But younger than I wanted to be,Suddenly my mission was clear.So for a while I conducted experiments,And I was amazed by the things I learned,From the fine, fine girl with nothing,But good intentions and a bad tendency to get burned.Oh, all about chemistry,Won't you show me everything you know,Ah wonder what you do to me Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh.Some time later I met a young graduate,When I had nobody to call my own,
My little darling it's a crying shame,The way that you lead me on,And I've got nobody but myself to blame,'Cause I've always just played along.Well show me a body that gets no love,And I'll show you a body that's way messed up,Well it seems like you're aware,Of the effect you have on my head.If you feel like I'm asking you for too much,We can keep in touch,And I'll find someone else to bed, bed,Find some, find someone else to bed, bed, bed,Find someone else.
Our little secret just might be the kind of thing that you can't hide,It's growing like a tangled vine and rising like a river in the tide,And everybody knew when you walked into the room,I was just a fool for you, nothing I could do,Everybody sees you taking control of me,Well I'm not begging for release,I'm just begging darling please, please.Act naturally, (act naturally)Don't let our troubles show,Don't let anybody know, (act naturally)Till we get it figured out,
She's got my number she always did,She can always see where my secrets hid,Everything about me is hers to tell,She's got my number she always will.She's got my number I must confess,One look in her eyes and I feel undressed,She can see right through all my little games,She's got my number she has my name.Late night driving with the telephone,In the car and I'm always,
I would sure love believing,In something that's never leaving,Would like to let go the hurting,When every things so uncertain.You know I tried,To show you what I have inside,Will we laugh at how this all began,When you're an old woman and I'm an old man.Take me wherever you go,Help me forget tomorrow,Love me your best and I know,
Lonely boys and your lonely girls,Here at the end of the lonely world,You're finding out if there's someone to cry about.Lonely girls and your lonely boys,Playing alone with your lonely toys,Well don't be blue 'cause there's no one to play with you.Get a grip on yourself you know you should,I got a grip on myself and it feels good,Get a grip on yourself take my advice,I got a grip on myself and it feels nice.When the lights come on and the party's through,There are always a few with nobody to do,
Wake up, here I go, cram it all down my throatStomach's so full that I wish I could chokeSeven a.m., my head's already in a spinAs soon as I'm out that doorBam, it hits me like a ton of those red bricksCan't dig myself out of this highest ditchThis madnessI swear sometimes I can't tellWhich way's up, which way's downIt's all up in my face, need to push it awaySomebody push it away, so all that I can hearIs a simple song, sing along nowLa, la, la, la, laLa, la, la, laLa, la, la, la, laLa, la, la, la
When I am down and oh my soul so wearyWhen troubles come and my heart burdened beThen I am still and wait here in the silenceUntil you come and sit awhile with meYou raise me up so I can stand on mountainsYou raise me up to walk on stormy seasAnd I am strong when I am on your shouldersYou raise me up to more than I can beYou raise me upThere is no life, no life without its hungerEach restless heart beats so imperfectly
Why boasteth thyself, O evil menPlaying smart and-a not being clever!I said you're working iniquityTo achieve vanity (if a-so, a-so),But the goodness of Jah - JahEndureth for everSo if you are the big tree,We are the small axeReady to cut you down, (well sharp)To cut you downThese are the words of my masterKeep on tellin' me: no weak out shall prosper
Yes, me friend,We deh a street again.Yes, me friend, me good friend,Dem say we free again.The bars could not hold me;Force could not control me now.They try to keep me down, yeah!But Jah put I around. Yeah!Yes, I've been accused many a timesAnd wrongly abused, now.Oh, but through the powers of the Most-I,They've got to turn me loose.
I'm giving up the ghost of loveAnd a shadow is cast on devotionShe is the one that I adoreQueen of my silent suffocationBreak this bittersweet spell on meLost in the arms of destinyBittersweet

From the point he gazed, from the choice was madeBut walk the cave or the shoreThe oily cave seemed to breathe on him from gravestone jawsHis little hand grasped in anguish as he weighed up his coinSomewhere a blue eyed girl in the world is just waiting for a boyFootprints trailed as if trod by slaves up to the gray cave floorBut not one graze from anything ever escaping this fortSo with coin on hand his joy came back when ordered to take the shoreWhy on earth, as he wandered the warmth am I obeying this coinTurn your life on the flip of this coinTurn upside, a choice you'd normally avoidAnd promise me you'll follow what it saysWhatever it saysAgain, walk within the trusted beach or swim the swell of the sea
Oh, thunder in my heartThese razors cutting sharpAnd leaves me with an ever bleeding scarSo soft, so suddenlySo that I cannot breatheI'm drawn into a circle painted blackOh, I'm hanging highOh, won't you let me down?Back where I started atYou know I'm a little lostAnd when it hurts the most
Had me a woman, give me all her loveShe gave me her blessing and I gave her my curseI drove her crazy, I drove her crazySent her insane like a one-way trainIn my lonely bed at night, wish that I could dieHell's comin' down, Hell's comin' downMade love in the morning, we got drunk at nightWhen she was sleepin' I stabbed her with a knifeI did deceive her, I was a midnight creeper
Dirty little secretDirty little liesSay your prayers and comb your hairSave your soul tonightDrift among the faithfulBury your desiresAberrations fill your headYou need a place to hide, and I amDo you remember me?And the kid I used to be?Do you remember me?When your world comes crashing downI want to be there (If God is looking down on me)I'm not Jesus, Jesus wasn't there!You confess it all awayBut it don't mean shit to me (If God is looking down on me)I'm not Jesus, I will not forgive!

You sounded so good on the phoneAll moved up and all moved onMe and gravity we never could agreeBut, I can almost see the skyWhen I need to I close my eyesYou're the only thing that's worth holding on toAngel you sing about beautiful things
When you lead meAnd fit around my toungeIt's so easy, to forget that i'm lostSpent all of my lifeWaiting for answersTo lift me, to numb me, to define it allSunshine, i'm beginning to like thisCause all i want to be is the minute that you hold me inWhen you pretend that i'm all that you waited forTime slips to nothing and i'm better than i've ever beenI'm suspended
I've been waiting up for you to rescue me,To come around and cover everything.Relying on my best memories,To breathe for me, breathe for me'So much better than all of this, all of this.I'm tired of singing all the sad songs in my head,But I can't find enough of anything to drown out what you said.And sometimes i find i catch myself letting you back inAnd im so tired of singing all the sad songs in my head.
And it's amazingWith the look in your eyesLike you could save meBut you won't even tryAnd then you tell me againHow everything will be alrightAnd if I told youThat I'm sorryWould you tell me that you were wrongOr would you hold me down foreverIf I came to your for answersAnd I sawPictures in my head
They tied off your armsWith all their pretty charmsAnd the same bad linesThat always get youAnd you hate the wayThey wash you downAnd summer hums heavy now...Still you bolded all your best wordsSo they'd have something to wrapTheir mouths around.Show me how pretty the world is.Cause i envy the way that you moveShow me how pretty the world is.
I tried to come down from youI tried with your voice in my headKnocking me backEvery inch I movedI'm a sucker for a good lieThe way you say you understandAnd how you always talk of catching meBut never open up your handTell me does the world revolve the sameTell me do the people all take care of youDid you doubt the curve of the earthAnd every word.Every wordI'll bet you heard
If I bent like you said was bestWould that change a thing?If I spend myself till nothing's leftWould you still leave me here?You're so sorry about it all now that it's overShould I thank you for that, dear?You're so sorry about it allAnd I hope you'll always beYes, I remember you bestHating all the boys who got to you
Took your word like you said I shouldAnd look at what good it's done meI've played support system, you played victimAnd look at what good it's doneYou trip me upYou leave me strangledWith your awkwardUntouchable lipsIt's a cruel world and I've foundIt's a cruel world and I'm a lucky boyIt's a cruel world and I've foundIt's a cruel world and I am your lucky boyYou're so glorious, you're a waste of my time
I'm weak when you miss meWhen you roll me on your tongueWhen you whisper me your best movesI almost believe youBut you don't know me at allI'm covered by loversWho recite linesConvinced that their bodiesAre gonna save mine, ohBut you don't know me at allShow me where the sun comes through the sky
You, you look to the stars for answersYour face glowin' in blueYou smile at the thought that there's somethin' out thereSuddenly a smile turns to a stareA million tiny light bulbs shiningThrough celluloid across the countryLittle green menEyes shielded with a shaky handThe women screamingAnd the children gather and wonderWho's thereWho's there
A long summers dayStretchin' out the cold.Searchin' for the answersAnd some say I'm not alone.Could you tell me,Where I might findFallen Horses,The spirits they fly.Blinded by the whitnessStarin' at the sun.I'm wishin' that I had wings,So that I can become one.

Well, you can give me all your loveAnd anything else you got tooBut don't pay it any mindIf it seems like I'm acting coolWell, you can dress me in your mirrorGive me kisses forever and a day yeahBut there's just one thingYou don't have to sayYou don't have to say you love meAnd you don't have to say any prayersNo, you don't have to say you love meBaby, it's alright'Cause honey, I don't careOh, baby, I don't careOh, honey, I don't careOh, honey, I don't careWell, you can turns the lights down lowSomethings are better that wayAnd you can tell me all your stories

I couldn't see darkness until nowOnly light!(Though sometimes the shadows flickered across my view)Light!But darkness, this cold emptiness,Somehow passed me byLike a charmed thing I sailedSlipping through its fingers
I'm so afraidSomething is broken nowToo much been saidTo wipe it clean somehowWithoutThis loveWhere will I beWithoutThis loveWhere will I beDarkness aboundsHeaviness weighs my heart'Round and round and roundWe've gonna have to be apart
LearnAre you feeling lost and lonely?You needn't beLike you've lost all hope and your sanityOh you needn't beIf we only have one turn
The thing that makesUs all the sameAnd melts the coldest heartWe try to runAnd hide in vainBut without loveWe'd fall apartThis world she knowsUs all so wellAnd wraps us in her armsThere's a one thing keepsUs out of hell
Hearts and flowersA picture of what a love should beBut when it comesIt's deeper thanThe darkest seaSometimes I'm so aloneEven in your armsLike each of usKeeps a little wallInside our hearts
You're not my boyfriendI don't want a boyfriendJust make a little trouble over meIn your kitchenOn the way to your windowWalking down your hallwayMake some trouble over meI'll play hard to getBut if I mean itJust make a little trouble over meLeave me aloneDo what you want toSee, I got some things on my mindDon't treat me badThat's not what I'm askingLook out your windowEveryone's in line

Without you, I have room to breatheAnd if I'm weak then you can't see my insecuritiesWithout you, I can do what I chooseCause when you got no one to love you got nothing to loseWill there come a time when my head finds it easier to not think about thisAnd I would do any thing to stop the weight of my heart getting heavierMy only conclusion isThat nothing compares to youNo matter where I lookNo matter what I doCause that garden of Eden you took me toIs now over grownAnd the love I've known is gone without youIs gone without youWithout you, I can kid myself
What's up?I dreamed I was drownin'In the river ThamesI dreamed I had nothing at allNothing but my own skinI dreamed I was driftingOn the howlin' windI dreamed I had nothing at allNothing but my own skinSlipped away from your open handsInto the riverSaw your face looking back at meI saw my past, and I saw my futureYou take the pieces of the dreams that you have'Cause you don't like the way they seem to be goin'You cut them up and spread them out on the floorYou're full of hope as you begin rearrangingPut it all back togetherBut any way you look at things looks like

Hold on, hold onLet me get the words out before I burstThere's no truth at allPoking at the giant eyes of ancient GodsCool heads have failedNow it's time for me to have my turnKiss me, kiss meLife is way too short to scream and shoutFlashed up in my wildest dreams the dark red blood streamsStretching out like vast cracked iceThe veins of you, the veins of me like great forest treesPushing through and on and inGliding like a satellite in the broken night
Tell me that you want to danceI want to feel your pulse on mineJust treat me like a stolen glanceTo yourselfA dark shape on a golden floorA sleeping planet with a molten coreFrom above we'd cut a slow eight shapeAnd much moreI'm a peasant in your princess arms
The yellowed page of the books and booksI'd forgotten that I hadThese paperbacks, they know their age they smellOf weight and time that's resting warmThe opened box beside the endless box paradeThat haunts my houseIs fit to split with photographs that tellThe wanderlust of years smashed on to yearsWhen all this actual life played outWhere the hell on earth was I?I rack my brains, but it won't comeThrough water damaged bloodshot eyesThe fleeting triumphs, brazen lies
The winter's marred the earthIt's floored with frozen glassYou slip into my armsAnd you quickly correct yourselfYour freezing speech bubblesSeem to hold your words aloftI want the smoky clouds of laughterTo swim about me forevermore
What if this storm ends?And I don't see youAs you are nowEver againThe perfect haloOf gold hair and lightningSets you off againstThe planet's last danceJust for a minuteThe silver forked skyLit you up like a starThat I will followNow it's found usLike I have found youI don't want to runJust overwhelm meWhat if this storm ends?And leaves us nothingExcept a memoryA distant echoI want pinned downI want unsettledRattle cage after cageUntil my blood boilsI want to see youAs you are nowEvery single dayThat I am livingPainted in flamesAll peeling thunderBe the lightning in me
You'll be given loveYou'll be taken care ofYou'll be given loveYou have to trust itMaybe not from the sourcesYou have poured yoursMaybe not from the directionsYou are staring atTwist your head aroundIt's all around you
Eventide rise for ritualWith the thrill of a kill vengefully the engine willRoar forth steer the dead leave forcedDriven by fear shift gears veer towardsThe foolishly equipped swift theseFailed bids breathed taillights from the cryptReflect upon the way beyond redemptionLet the necronometer beckon for the destinedBlessed when first lent sin then condemned to bear the burdenOf this curse the consequence of which can never be avertedEach tormented attempt that is made in vainTo evade this debt which is certain to be paidWithout question is met with a counterclocked surgeIn reverse as if backmasked words of the black mass wereAll heard by a clutch engagedOver trails blazed to the western gates(Ville Valo)Heaven may be running on empty yet the devil rides
It always sucks refolding the kind of mapNeeded when I get stuck where the sun don't shine the factIs if I just shut up my rubbered stamp could flag you as dumbIt ain't your mind you're givin' me a piece ofAs it don't take Einstein to know that's just obscene butIt's been Buck Rogers' time since I hit other than rock bottomEven the odds of having you against meWith your crotchless jihad on blue balls evidentlyAre all mighty good God so angel dust my soul like James BrownStreet legal whore hauling so much stunning assSell yourself short like Bridget at the bunny ranchDo it all fours the satisfaction of getting fouledI'm the least you could do

A loved one laid his head on her lapRed roses fell to the floorAnd the world, stood stillMy mouth was a crib and it was growing liesI didn't know what love was on that dayHer heart's a tiny bloodclotI picked at itIt never heals it never goes awayI burned all the good things in The Eden EyeWe were too dumb to run too dead to dieI burned all the good things in The Eden EyeWe were too dumb to run too dead to dieThis was never my worldYou took the angel awayI'd kill myself to make everybody payThis was never my worldYou took the angel away
Is this what you wanted?This is what you getTurned all your lives into this shitYou never accepted or treated me fairBlame me for what I believeAnd I wearYou fucked yourselves and youRaised these sheepThe blue and the withered seedsYou will reapYou never gave me a chance to be me
You'll say, we've got nothing in commonNo common ground to start fromAnd we're falling apartYou'll say, the world has come between usOur lives have come between usStill I know you just don't careAnd I said what about Breakfast at Tiffany'sShe said I think I remember the filmAnd as I recall I think we both kind of liked itAnd I said well that's the one thing we've got
If I woke up one morning with my memory goneI'd pick out some clothes and I'd put them onThen I'd walk down the street and find a cafeAnd I'd order a Guiness and I'd sit there all dayThen some kids would come in and start a fussAbout how great their weekend in New Orleans wasI'd look down and smile like their tale was my ownI'd be drowning in memory, and then I would knowHow it used to be in summer, so many years agoWhen we really didn't worry, or care to knowWhere we would be, or how old we had grown
Little girl with the press and curlAge eight, I got a Jheri curlThirteen, and I got a relaxerI was a source of so much laughterAt fifteen when it all broke offEighteen and I went all naturalFebruary, 2002I went on and did what I had to doBecause it was time to change my lifeTo become the woman that I am insideNinety-seven dreadlocks all goneI looked in the mirror for the first time and saw thatHey (hey)I am not my hairI am not this skinI am not your expectations, no (hey)I am not my hairI am not this skinI am the soul that lives withinGood hair means curls and waves (no)Bad hair means you look like a slave (no)
There is no combination of wordsI could put on the back of a postcardNo song that I could singBut I can try for your heartOur dreamsAnd they are made out of real thingsLike a shoebox of photographsWith sepia-toned lovingLove is the answer at leastFor most of the questions in my heartLike why are we here? And where do we go?And how come it's so hard?It's not always easyAnd sometimes life can be deceivingI'll tell you one thingIt's always better when we're together
I heard this old story beforeWhere people keep appealing for the metaphorsDon't leave much up to the imaginationSo I wanna give this imagery backNo, it just ain't so easy like thatSo, I turn the page and read the story againAnd again and againIt sure seems the same with a different nameWe're breaking and rebuildingAnd we're growingAlways guessingNever knowingShocking but we're nothingWe're just momentsWe're clever but we're cluelessWe're just humanAmusing and confusingWe're trying but where is this all leadingWe'll never knowIt all happened so much faster than you could say disaster
It's such a tired gameWill it ever stop?How will this all play outOf sight, out of mind nowBy now we should know how to communicateInstead of coming to blows, we're on a rollAnd there ain't no stopping us nowWe're burning under controlIsn't it strange how we're allBurning under the same sun?Buy now and save, it's a war for peaceIt's the same old gameBut do we really want to play?We could close our eyes, it's still thereWe could say it's us against themWe could try but nobody winsGravity has got a hold on us all

The light was leaving in the west, it was blueThe children's laughter sangSkipping just like the stones they threwTheir voices echoed across the wavesIt's getting lateIt was just another nightWith a sunset and a moonriseNot so far behindTo give us just enough lightTo lay down underneath the stars

Light breaks underneath a heavy doorAnd I try to keep myself awakeFall all around us on our hotel floorAnd you think that you've made a mistakeAnd there's a pain in my stomach from another sleepless bingeAnd I struggled to get myself up againI wanna hang onto somethingThat won't break away or fall apartLike the pieces of my heartAnd globes and maps are all around me nowI wanna feel you breathe meGlobes and maps I see surround you here
At Cavanaugh ParkWhere I used to sitAll alone in the darkAnd dream about thingsThat I cannot sayYou always said destinyWould blow me awayAnd nothings gonna blow me awayAt Cavanaugh ParkWhere you used to take meTo play in the sandAnd said to me sonOne day you'll be a manAnd men can do terrible thingsYes they canThere was never any placeFor someone like meTo be totally happyI'm running out of clockAnd that ain't a shock
All aloneIn this heat m-yy thoughtsStart to wanderOn my lonesome in this worldMy hands start to long forYour skinMy mouth starts to long forYour kissYour kissAnd the sun burns my skinBut it's outside and in, it's burning
LAMB: ZEROThere's no one here today'Cause someone took the light awayThere's nothing in my heartDon't think I could even start to explainI can't stand the painOf losing something so much a part of meThough in realityYou were hardly there in my heartYou were everything, everythingYou were everything, everythingIn these few hoursA breath of summertime has turned to winter rainIn such little timeAll my hope has goneWill it ever be the same?
Things change yet so much stays the sameLife's just a dream we have of realityLove's strength enhances what we haveAnd then it strips us of our sanityStill i stayGrowing strongEvery dayCloser to youIt's strangeBut somehow obviousThat what we want the mostWe must let goYour head is freer still than mineAnd not so cluttered with morality
If I should die this very moment, I wouldn't fearFor I've never known completeness like being hereWrapped in the warmth of you, loving every breath of youStill my heart this moment, oh it might burstCould we stay right here till the end of timeUntil the earth stops turningWanna love you until the seas run dryI've found the one I've waited forAll this time I've loved you and never known your faceAll this time I've missed you and searched this human race
One foot strands before the cribThe other by the casketA question formed upon stilled lipsIs passed on but never askedI guess I believe that there's a pointTo what we doBut I ask myself is thereSomething more besides you?Two are born to cross
If you offered me a shade of blueWould I return it saying that it was tooDark or light?Or would I see it for the precious thingThat it might one day be?Hold on to meIf you offered me a point of viewWould I dismiss it saying that it was tooBlack and white?
Could you be loved and be loved?Could you be loved and be loved?Don't let them fool yaOr even try to school ya! Oh, no!We've got a mind of our ownSo go to hell if what you're thinking is not right!Love would never leave us aloneAy, in the darkness there must come out the lightCould you be loved and be loved?Could you be loved, wo now, and be loved?(The road of life is rocky, and you may stumble too)(So while you point your fingers, someone else is judging you)Love your brotherman(Could you be, could you be, could you be loved?)(Could you be, could you be loved?)

[Written by Paul Simon][Copyright 1965 Paul Simon Music -BMI][Heir Apparent arrangement by Terry Gorle 1987]Hello darkness my old friendI've come to talk with you againBecause a vision softly creepingLeft it's seeds while I was sleepingAnd a vision that was planted in my brainStill remains -Within the sound of silenceIn restless dreams I walked aloneNarrow streets of cobblestone'Neath the halo of a streetlampI turned my collar to the cold and dampWhen my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light-That split the nightAnd touched the sound of silenceAnd in the naked light I sawTen thousand people, maybe morePeople talking without speakingPeople hearing without listeningPeople writing songs that voices never share-And no one daredDisturb the sound of silence"Fools", said I, "You do not know""Silence, like a cancer, grows""Hear my words, that I might teach you"
Here in this crowd I'm feeling all aloneTurn me around, and point me back to homeI'm getting lost more everyday and I can't tear myself awayFrom the stars in my eyes with no lightHere are my terms, have some faith in meAnd I'll let you be who you need to beLife on the moonCouldn't be any strangerLife on the moonWouldn't feel as far awayThe life that I knew, it's throughAnd I'm gonna need you more than everI'm alone in this crowded roomIt's like life on the moon
You whispered that you were getting tiredGotta look in your eyeLooks a lot like goodbyeHold on to your secrets tonightDon't want to knowI'm okay with this silenceThis truth that I don't want to hearYou're hiding regret in your smileThere's a storm in your eyes I've seen coming for a whileHang on to the past tense tonightDon't say a wordI'm okay with the quietThe truth is gonna change everythingSo lie to me and tell me that it's gonna be alrightSo lie to me and tell me that we'll make it through the night
Are you goin' to Scarborough Fair?Parsley, sage, rosemary and thymeRemember me to one who lives thereShe once was a true love of mineTell her to make me a cambric shirt(On the side of a hill in the deep forest green)Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme(Tracing a sparrow on snow-crested ground)Without no seams nor needlework(Blankets and bedclothes, the child of the mountain)
A winters dayIn a deep and dark DecemberI am aloneGazing from my window to the streets belowOn a freshly fallen silent shroud of snowI am a rockI am an islandI've built wallsA fortress deep and mightyThat none may penetrateI have no need of friendship; friendship causes pain
Bobby went out for a joy ride with my best girl, left me at the party,It was almost June and the three-quarter moon illuminatedThe rain-soaked streets like a candy wrapper.I guess that's why Bobby had his lights off,Tear-assing through them back streets of town,Where me and Bobby tear-assed so many times before.Sometimes with my best girl and sometimes Bobby had him one too.

It's a good year for a murderShe's praying to JesusShe's pulling the triggerThere's no tearsCause he's not hereShe washes her handsAnd she fixes the dinnerBut soon they'll be coming to rush her awayNo one's so sure if her crime had a reasonBut reasons like seasons they constantly changeAnd the seasons of lies still like reasons are flowing, awayAway with this spilled milk?Away with this dirty dishwater?Away

It's strange to think the songs we used to singThe smiles, the flowers, everything is goneWell, yesterday I found out about youEven now just looking at you feels wrongAnd you say that you'd take it all back given one chanceIt was a moment of weakness and you said, yesYou should've said no, you should've gone homeYou should've thought twice 'fore you let it all goYou shouldn've known that word'Bout what you did with her'd get back to meYeah, and I should've been there in the back of your mindI shouldn't be asking myself whyYou shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
Sometimes I get so tired,Just trying to find a place to lay my head.I look up to the sky,I feel the warmest light comfort me.I've seen the great heights,Reminding me that I'm alive.I don't wanna die,I don't wanna waste another day,Or night,I know there's something moreThan what we're living for,I see it in the stars,I feel it on the shore,I know there's something,I know there's something more.I think we're all afraid,That we might be alone,
I don't care what they think about me andI don't care what they sayI don't care what they think, if you're leavingI'm gonna beg you to stayI don't care if they start to avoid meI don't care what they doI don't care about anything elseBut being with you, being with youHoney don't go, don't leave this sceneBe out of the picture and off of the screenDon't let them say "we told you so"They tell me you'll love me and then let me goI've heard the warning voiceFrom friends and my relationsThey tell me all about your heart-break reputation
Hearts on fireMy love for you brought only miseryHearts on firePut out the flames and set this cold heart freeOne short year our love had burnedUntil at last I guess you learnedThe art of being untrueAnd then goodbyeWhat could I do except to cry and moan?Lord, what have I done?
Time can pass and time can healBut it don't ever pass the way I feelYou went away a long time agoAnd why you left I never knewThe lonely days and lonely nightsGuess the world knows I ain't feelin' rightAnd when you're gone the hours pass so slowAnd now I'm still feeling blueAnd babySince you've walked out of my lifeI never felt so low

I met my girl at Woolwich Pier beneath the big crane standingAnd all the love I felt for her it passed all understandingTook her sailing on the river, flow sweet river flowLondon town was mine to give her, sweet Thames flow softlyMade the Thames into a crown, flow sweet river flowMade a brooch of Silver town, sweet Thames flow softlyAt London Yard I held her hand, at Blackwell Point I faced herAt the Isle of Dogs I kissed her mouth and tenderly embraced her
Come all ye fair and tender ladiesTake warning how you court your menThey're like a star on a cloudy morningFirst they'll appear and then they're goneThey'll tell to you some loving storyThey'll swear to you their love is trueStraight way they'll go and court anotherAnd that's the love that they had for youOh don't you remember our days of courting
I'll fascinate you for awhileMy hands in wait to please, so wellWhen I wake to realize, all I'd doneI'll be breaking stringsAnd all you're gonna feelIs undoneI will not stay if you ask me to stayDo not ask me to stay because I will not stay

I hear the drizzle of the rainLike a memory it fallsSoft and warm, continuingTapping on my roof and wallsAnd from the shelter of my mindThrough the window of my eyesI gaze beyond the rain-drenched streetsTo England, where my heart lies
You have your very own numberThey dress your cage in it's natureOnce you roared now you just grunt lamePace around pathetic pound gamesWanna get out won't miss you sensaroundTo carry your own dead to swing your tyre tricksWanna get out in here you're bred dead quick
Conscience binds you in chainsTrail by stone hammer and nailsNo- one made the holes but meMisery mourns to be devouredKilled God blood soiled unclean againKilled God soiled skin dead againAgain everywhere againAll removables, all transitory
Embarrassed possessed and so uncivilizedJust take a look at the whites of my eyesSee me now and I will apologiesFor me, for you, we knew they were liesIt makes me angry, ashamed but really aliveIt may have worked but at what priceWhat's the point in always looking backWhen all you see is more and more junk

Years ago, I met my loverOn the banks of the stormy JordanYears ago, I met my loverHow I wish that we could meet againHave I lost my faith in you?Are we all forgotten too?
When I came down the dawn poured into meI shook'em up the walls came crumblingMy fists kept trembling with these salty woundsMy stolen gold inside the emperors tombNow painting rainbows on my ugly faceI built this cardboard neighborhoods disgraceBut I ascend and serve my feverish needWithin the confines of such chemistryIt's the way I seeEverything I needIt's no way to beLet this be our little secretNo one needs to know we're feelingHigher and higher and higherHigher and higher and higherBut I feel alive and I feel it in meUp and up I keep on climbingHigher and higher and higherHigher and higher and higherMy face blew up at such a casual sightThe spattered colors of ecstatic fright
Dear friend, as you knowYour flowers are witheringYour mother's gone insaneYour leaves have drifted awayBut the clouds are clearing upAnd I've come revelingBurning incandescentlyLike a bastard on the burning seaYou're just like your fatherBuried deep under the waterYou're resting on your laurelsAnd stepping on my toesWhose side are you on?What side is this anyway?
We dug these holes we crawled into now they're my homeNow here I can not feel the wind, can't feel the rain or coldAnd I believe in gentle harmonyWell how I loathe all this obscenityIs this the way my life has got to be?Have I a single opportunity?Look at me oh look at me is this the way I'll always beOh no, oh noNow I pray that somebody will quickly come and kidnap meOh no, oh noEveryday I lie awake and pray to God today's the dayOh no, oh no
Leave me aloneLeave me aloneLeave me aloneI'm fineI'll be fine until the morning comesThen unmask me in the blistering sunOh let me goJust let me goJust let me goOr I'llBurst in front of your eyesThen collect myself from the ground
That's a frosty way to speak,To tell me how to live next to your potpourriAll this talking pulls my teethI believed in you, so you believed inMe, I cried out "God"You dared me in the darkI felt a hush fall quietly from my sparkSo now I hide in piles of princely orange peelsIt feels the way you told me how it'd always feelOnce I had an name to call youIt scraped along the walls like an orthodox saintI wish for the same old things that turn me inside out
Some day you'll seeSurrounded by angelsFloating atop of the seaOn banded kneesDon't go where they goDon't sing all the songs they singNobody knows you the way you know youBut I think I doBut I thought I knewYeah, I thought I knewNobody knows you the way you know youBut I think I doWhen I thought I knewYeah, I thought I knewBetween these walls
Chorus:She's a tamale drunk on corvsierShe wanna party after the partyShe wanna private dance with somebodyCause her body gotta a mind of its own 'own.oh oh oh own.Nah nah nah nah na na na na na'.Just the way how she move her bodyYou can tell that shes a tamaleHips moving like a ferrariYou can tell that shes a tamale(Repeat)Verse 1:As soon as she walked thru the door aha ahaAnd back her thing up on the floor aha ahaIts getting hot it's a bout to blowTell the firetruck to bring the hoseShowing off her belly skinLooking sexy with naval ring
You know I like my chicken friedA cold beer on a Friday nightA pair of jeans that fit just rightAnd the radio u-upWell I was raised up beneath the shade of a Georgia pineAnd that's home you knowSweet tea pecan pie and homemade wineWhere the peaches growAnd my house it's not much to talk aboutBut it's filled with love that's grown in southern groundAnd a little bit of chicken friedCold beer on a Friday nightA pair of jeans that fit just rightAnd the radio upWell I've seen the sunriseSee the love in my woman's eyesFeel the touch of a precious childAnd know a mother's love
A moment in time, rosin the bowSound the strings of years agoA sunlit room at Glenties fairA traveller plays a haunting airA story told, the laughter peelThe fiddler strikes another reel
With her head in the clouds,She keeps her distance and keeps resistingThey're so proud of what she's missing,She is so delightedWhy must I find that falling downBrings my hopes high, oh so highWhy must you cry when I fall down?It helps me with the truth insideThe fear is tempting,It consumes themThe loving darkness they claim she's missingThe job is hers to keep resisting
You grew up in this country townI'm stuck out here and it's been foreverWhere doing nothing is allowedAnd all of my friends just say whateverOnce you're hereYou're here to stayYour life is made upGot no sayI never see the light of dayYou're so convincingYou talk a lotAbout how this is all you gotIf you don't rememeber times long ago'Cause sooner or laterTime gave them up
I lose some sales and my boss won't be happyBut I can't stop listening to the soundOf two soft voices blended in perfectionFrom the reels of this record that I foundEvery day there's a boy in the mirrorAsking me what are you doing hereFinding all my previous motivesGrowing increasingly unclear
I walked around for hours, two ten pence pieces in my handI was alone and freezing, still trying hard to understand youI left the others knowing, I had to work this by myselfBut now the feeling's growing, I would be better off with their help
Five weeks in a prison, I made no friendsThere's more time to be done, but I've got a week to spendI didn't pay much attention first time aroundBut now you're hard not to notice, right here in my townWhere the stage of my old life meets the cast of the newTonights actors: Me and YouEach day is taking us closerWhile drawing the curtains to close
All I do is sleep all day, and think of youA memory of the cushion life I'm clinging toThe image of a mutual one, our havenThe sombre chords of our song, the fadingLove is no big truthDriven by our genes, we are simple selfish beings
I'd rather dance with you than talk with youSo why don't we just move into the other roomThere's space for us to shake and hey, I like this tuneEven if I could hear what you saidI doubt my reply would be interesting for you to hearBecause I haven't read a single book all yearAnd the only film I saw I didn't like it at allI'd rather dance, I'd rather dance than talk with you
Without giving anything awayI can say it's by the seaIt's a house that used to beThe home of a friend of mineWithout giving anything awayWe find ships inside of bottlesWhen the garden's overgrown
Postcards and lettersAnd pictures made to last foreverTo be boxed up and tossed awayKnick-knacks and souvenirsIn an afternoon, they're out of hereThey'll disappear without a traceBut what they mean to me can never be replacedI can't unthink about youI can't unfeel your touchI can't unhear all the wordsUnsay all the thingsThat used to mean so muchI wish I could unremember
Everybody makes mistakes,But I feel alright when I come undoneYou're not not making me wait,But it seems alright as long as something's happeningI try to make you late,But you fight me out like a fire doesYou try making me wait,But it feels alright as long as something's happening.Get your payments from the nationFor your trials and tribulations

Come on!Does she walk? Does she talk?Does she come complete?My homeroom homeroom angel always pulled me from my seatShe was pure, like snowflakes no one could ever stainThe memory of my angel could never cause me painYears go by, I'm lookin' through a girly magazineAnd there's my homeroom angel on the pages in-betweenMy blood runs coldMy memory has just been soldMy angel is the centerfold (Angel is the centerfold)My blood runs cold, whoa!My memory has just been sold(Angel is the centerfold)Slipped me notes under the deskWhile I was thinkin' about her dressI was shy, I turned away before she caught my eyeI was shakin' in my shoesWhenever she flashed those baby bluesSomething had a hold on me when angel passed close byThose soft, fuzzy sweaters, too magical to touch

Days are long but the minds are strongIn the factoryHeads are down and all the people frownIn the factoryI'm so down I put my head around every noose I see
Three o'clock in the morningAnd it looks like it's going to be another sleepless nightI've been listenin' to your dreams and getting very lowWondering what I can doMaybe I'm being foolish 'cause I haven't heard you mention anybody's name at allHow I wish I could be sure it's me that turns you onEach time you close your eyesI've heard it said that dreamers never lieYou've been talking in your sleepSleeping in your dreams
Had you there in the palm of my hand.Saw that smile you give that girl.Haven't seen that smile such a long time.Don't do this to me, again.I watched you laugh when you walked out through door,Couldn't save you from yourself.Haven't seen that smile for such a long while.Don't do this to me again.
There's a clear blue sky overheadA clear blue sky the sun is shiningI'm in New YorkAnd it's freezing coldAll I got is a phone numberFrom a girl called TrishikaTried calling her three times alreadyBut her phone is constantly engagedShe told me to give her a callIf I was ever in town
Overcast future and the past riding on a dimeNo control ever will hold of my lifeBut I look inside the darkest night I know there's a day (what you say)So listen to the words of life I heard my father sayHe said Keep your head up to the sky don't be shyTrust in what you know is right and I'll provideKeep your head up to the sky don't be shyTrust in what you know is right and I'll provideCan't find a job for money will rob or do I have to take itQuestion fate who do I have to hate in order to be great
In the sky the birds are pullin' rainIn your life a curse has got a nameMakes you lay awake all through the nightThat's whyShe's intoxicated by herselfEveryday she's seen with someone elseAnd every night she kisses someone new
Things seem so much better whenThey're not part of your close surroundingsLike words in a letter sentAmplified by the distancePossibilities and sweeter dreamsSights and sounds calling form far awayCalling from far awayI didn't know you then, now did I girl?I couldn't hear you singing softly to me
You called me after midnightMust have been three years since we last spokeI slowly tried to bring backThe image of your face from the memories so oldI tried so hard to followBut didn't catch a half of what had gone wrong
Using the Guardian as a shieldTo cover my thighs against the rainI do not mind about my hairYour jacket may be waterproofBut I know the moment you get homeYou're gonna get your trousers changedFailure is always the best way to learn
There are very many thingsI would like to say to youBut I've lost my wayAnd I've lost my wordsThere are very many placesI would like to go but ICan't find the keyTo open my doorThe weight of my wordsYou can't feel it anymoreThe weight of my wordsYou can't feel it anymore
Your eyes are coldI know you'll tell me allNot to fallI lean against the wallI'm on the floorNot listening anymore

I thought I'd see you smileWhen I walked in the doorThought those arms of yours would be open wideThe way they were beforeWhy do you look at me like I'm some stranger tonight?Why do you pull away when you used to hold me so tight?Don't you love me anymore?Have you learned to live your life without me?Don't you love me anymore, anymore?When did the fire go out?Where did the feeling go?Did it slip away when I wasn't there?And now I've come home

While she lays sleepingI stay out late at night and play my songsAnd sometimes all the nights can be so longAnd it's good when I finally make it home, all aloneWhile she lays dreamingI try to get undressed without the lightAnd quietly she says, "How was your night?"And I come to her and say"It was all right," and I hold her tightAnd she believes in meI'll never know just what she sees in meI told her someday if she was my girlI could change the worldWith my little songs, I was wrong
In a bar in ToledoAcross from the depotOn a barstool, she took off her ringI thought I'd get closerSo I walked on overI sat down and asked her, her nameWhen the drinks finally hit herShe said, "I'm no quitter"But I finally quit living on dreamsI'm hungry for laughterAnd here ever afterI'm after whatever the other life bringsIn the mirror I saw himAnd I closely watched himI thought how he looked out of placeHe came to the womanWho sat there beside meHe had a strange look on his face

Love,I'm aching to believeGive me something real enoughGive me somewhere to fall from'Cause in the darkI can't find my feetBuilt my world on promisesColorless and coldI'm short of breath, I'm sureGone, let it wash away the best I hadGone, and when I disappearDon't expect me back, don't expect me backLost, sweetest things get lostIn the static far away
So we lie here in the darkAll the wrong things on fireIn sickness and in healthTo be with youJust to be with youAnd in your wedding dressTo have and to holdEven at my bestI want to let goAnd you hold me in your armsWhen all that I can seeIs my future in your handsAnd all that I can feelIs how long ever after isWhen it's all that I can do
Somewhere in betweenThe beginning and the endSeptember took the touristsAnd settled in for goodWe could hear the trains againBrooklyn girls in scarvesSummer left and no one said a wordAnd we'd open your windowAnd stay in your bed all day'Til the street lights came onSo what happened to bulletproof weeks in your arms?
I remeber hearts that beatYeah yeahI remember you and meYeah oh yeahTangled in hotel sheetsYou wore me outYou wore me outI remember honey lipsAnd words so trueI remember non-stop earthquake dreams of youComing on fast like good dreams doAll night longI still can feel you kiss me loveStill can see your brown skin shining (shining)

What did you say?I know I saw you sayin'But my ears won't stop ringin'Long enough to hear those sweet wordsWhat did you say?End of the day, the hour hand has spunBut before the night is doneI just have to hear those sweet wordsSpoken like a melody
Come away with me, in the nightCome away with meAnd I will write you a songCome away with me, on a busCome away where they can't tempt usWith their lies
Uh, from the first time that I loved you...I told you from the startOur love would come togetherIf we could stand to be apartI never mean to break to you heart,NoThe days I cope without youI feel so all aloneI see you in my dreams at nightI feel your touch so strong(So strong)I feel your pain and tears miles awayI surrender my soul to you dearLove youLove youLove youLoveMishaleWhat am I supposed to doMishaleI'll never get over youMishale (Mishale)Loving you is heaven

I've been waitingI've been waiting for this moment all my lifeBut it's not quite rightAnd this 'real'It's impossible if possibleAt whose blind wordSo clear but so unheardI've been waitingI've been waiting for this silence all night longIt's just a matter of time
It's a beautiful morning, ahI think I'll go outside for a whileAnd just smileJust take in some clean fresh air, boyNo sense in staying insideIf the weather's fine and you've got the timeIt's your chance to wake up and plan another brand new dayEither wayIt's a beautiful morning, ahEach bird keeps singing his own songSo longI've got to be on my way nowNo fun just hanging aroundI got to cover ground
I open my lungsTo breathe in forgiveness and loveHaunting me nowReminders of how I used to beAnd on down the roadThe troubles are sure to followLooking out the windowThe hell if I know where I will goSo I'll just keep on driving...On my way to LALooking into the rear-viewAs the roads fade awayI've sworn off my pastThe first to last bad callThat I ever madeAnd tell me how to make rightEvery wrong turn that I've learnedSo this could all end tonightTennessee line just changed my mindWell, it's my heart I'll follow this timeWho would've known
You never said, you never said, you never saidThat it would be this hardLove was meant to be forever, now or neverSeems too discardThere's gotta be a better way for me to sayWhat's on my heart without leaving scarsSo can you hear meWhen I call your name?And when you fall apartAm I the reason for your endless sorrow?There's so much to be saidAnd with a broken heartYour walls can only go down but so lowCan you hear meWhen I call your name?When I call your name?Complicated situations are the makings of all that's wrong

Dreams of violance and murders fall down hardInterzonic genocide high, the affusion of lifeNow it's time for suicide, to break the pure disbeliefIt's time to riddle the flaws of the physique of the motorsAnd as we walk to the lost grounds of heaven tonightTo the battered face of the soulWe are damned from power, burnt black
Energize me with a simple touchOr with an open heartEnergize me, fire up this flameThat's burning between usIt's not a fantasyAnother mysteryIt's just what I can feelAnd something I can seeIt's like a memoryAnd in a melodyIt's just what we all knowAnd we all hearI was blindI was closed downCould not feelOr set it freeEnergize me with a simple touchOr with an open heart

Wake Up In HellI can't go onEach second lasts foreverI stand motionless in sorrowThis must be the endDrown in waters black beneath meI see nothing here but failureThough I still pretendWhat am I suppose to do?Carry on or lose my will?I've seen what hell is likeAnd you have put me here
Making friends with the moon,Ooh one can't start to soon.Cause if you don't, then you will find yourselfCrawling in corners, rolling in circles,Forgetting about the soup.When you loose all your skin, cause you let it all bangAnd you just tried 15 tmes to get a rip.Dispose your good thoughts, making the wrong ones better.
I was not involved up at the Northtown mallAs a matter of fact I didn't even know that that's where it happenedI was France Ave when they came out dancing, I was Lyndale South, I was kicking it with cousinsWe were talking about going clubbing but instead we just started drinkingI've been straight since the Cinco de MayoBut before that I was blotto, I was blacked outI was cracked out, I was caved inYou should have seen all these portals that I've powered up inWe started recreationalIt ended kinda medicalIt came on hot and softAnd then it tightened up its tentaclesI wasn't thereI was blind, high, I was scaredI was lake and Columbus, I was cutting off all my hairI was unfurling a flag of defiance aimed at my guidance guy
I can remember when we walked togetherSharing a love I thought would last foreverMoonlight to show the way so we can followWaiting inside her eyes was my tomorrowThen somethin' changed her mind, her kisses told meI had no lovin' arms to hold meEvery day I wake up, then I start to break upLonely is a man without loveEvery day I start out, then I cry my heart outLonely is a man without love

So she say's "What's this about?"Inside mahogany cyprus?As long as we're me and youWe should not lose terrainWhen we were young, we got seasickOn your seventh get off cheapThat sits with herAnd the warmth of it splattersWe all can wring her neckFirst, we gain new terrainWhile we're young, we get seasickOn your seven soft sheets
Artilleryman: Halt! Who goes there?Journalist: Er - friend.Artilleryman: Be on your way. This is my territory.Journalist: Your territory? What do you mean?Artilleryman: Wait a minute - it's you! The man from Maybury Hill!Journalist: Good heavens! The Artilleryman! I thought you surely burned.Artilleryman: I thought you surely drowned.Journalist: Have you seen any Martians?Artilleryman: Everywhere. We're done for all right.Journalist: We can't just give up.Artilleryman: Course we can't. It's now we've got to start fighting - but not against them 'cos we can't win. Now we've got to fight for survival, and I reckon we can make it. I've got a plan.Artilleryman: We're gonna build a whole new world for ourselves. Look, they clap eyes on us and we're dead, right? So we gotta make a new life where they'll never find us. You know where? Underground.You should see it down there - hundreds of miles of drains - sweet and clean now after the rain, dark, quiet, safe. We can build houses and everything, start again from scratch.And what's so bad about living underground eh? It's not been so great living up here, if you want my opinion.Take a look around you at the world we've come to knowDoes it seem to be much more than a crazy circus showBut maybe from the madness something beautiful will growIn a brave new worldWith just a handful of menWe'll start - we'll start all over again - all over again - all over again - all over againWe'll build shops and hospitals and barracks right under their noses - right under their feet! Everything we need - banks, prisons and schools... We'll send scouting parties to collect books and stuff, and men like you'll teach the kids. Not poems and rubbish - science, so we can get everything working. We'll build villages and towns and... and... we'll play each other at cricket! Listen, maybe one day we'll capture a fighting machine, eh? Learn how to make 'em ourselves and then wallop! Our turn to do some wiping out! Whoosh with our Heat Ray - Whoosh! And them running and dying, beaten at their own game. Man on top again!
When everything is gone and no one's left to carry onLook through the ashes of what was to beI wear the badge of the dispossessed and the label that don't belongI feel the stab in the dark and all that was mine is taken awayI am. I was. Everything you see.I am. I was. Never meant to be.

I was raised off of rural route threeOut past where the blacktop endsWe'd walk to church on Sunday morningAnd race barefoot back to Johnson's fenceThat's where I first saw MaryOn that roadside pickin' blackberriesThat summer I turned the corner in my soulDown that red dirt roadIt's where I drank my first beerIt's where I found JesusWhere I wrecked my first carI tore it all to piecesI learned the path to heavenIs full of sinners and believersLearned that happiness on earthAin't just for high achievers (I heard)I've come to know there's life at both endsOf that red dirt road

I burnt the bridge that you were buildingBut I left here feeling guiltyThat we couldn't see eye to eyeWhy can't we compromise?Why are we choosing sides?When will we realize?We don't have to fight anymoreWhere is the love we had before?Wouldn't the world be better off if we decide?We don't need our pride anymoreWhere is the love we had before?Where is the love? Where is the love?Where is the love, the love we had before?
Is this the whole pictureOr is it just the start?Is this the way you love me?You're capturing my heartI used to try and walk aloneBut I've begun to growAnd when you tell me just to restI'm finally letting goI let goAnd I'm here to stayNothing can separate usAnd I know, I'm okYou cradle me gently

You set yourself aboveThat all forgiving godYou claim that you believe inYour kind is gonna fallYour ship is sinking fastAnd all your able men are leavingOnly someoneWho's morallySuperior can possiblyAnd honestly deserve
The telegraph gave us hopeBefore was the silence and the panic it broughtThe sky was the blankest sheetWe drew lines upon itSo our thoughts could meetThrough cables black and coldWe carry our intentions to bridgeAnd bring homeWould it all be so clearIf the lines were erased
I'm letting goTo see if you'll hold on to meI'm in doubtOf what is thought and what is realIn our roomBetween the shapes I thought I knewA guillotineA pillow with feathers like snowI've comeTo a listening post beyond your linesI'm all earsTo gather clues and look for signs
I see you changing girlFrom Day to DayImpressed by and trying to imitateThose who are olderThose who are colderSuddenly embarrassed by your ageOur bigger blessing, girl
Feeling the comfort of eyes is your sole intentionWe all want to be understood unconditionallyBut you have to realize that a viewer needs distanceAnd the moment your wall melts down the inside is outside
We'll be rich in memories of all the placesWe've captured without cameraWe've seen the pyramidsWe've seen the LouvreWe've seen Orion upside downTotal eclipses and the moonlight shadowsWe've seen dolphins jumping wavesWe've ski'ed the mountains and we swam in the riversAnd let the sunlight dry our skin
"Why, why so quiet?Oh my, mysterious country singer?" she asked.My life, it's a riotI'm climbing barricadesIn empty streets at night.When I'm downFighting shadows.
He won't touch you anymore,Staying at his side.Half indifferent, half afraid,It will only make you cry.What is given can't be returned.The cards are in our hands.All that is living can be hurt,
Should've kissed you thereI should've held your faceI should've watched those eyesInstead of runnin' placeI should've called you outI should've said your nameI should've turned aroundI should've looked againBut, ohI'm staring at the mess I madeI'm staring at the mess I madeI'm staring at the mess I madeAs you turn, you take your heart and walk awayShould've held my ground
I've been beaten downI've been kicked aroundBut she takes it all for meAnd I lost my faithIn my darkest daysBut she makes me want to believeThey call her love, love, love, love, love
Look behind youAvoid the shadowsWatch your back nowMake your breathing shallowKeep your room lockedAnd leave the blinds closedI'm right there staring at your windowAnd all I need is you, all I need is youI'm in the background on the radioI'm in your car, in your house, waiting at your door
Loving you I could spend foreverLoving you could transcend the heavens 'cause of youYou turned all my gray skies blueSince we met, yours is the only kiss I can't forgetYou're my Romeo and I'm your JulietYou're like a dream come trueDon't need no money, no fortune or fame
They put a needle once in my spineIt took them so long to find itI can't get this pornfilm out of my headLet's get on with itIt is banging insideIt is singing aloudGet on with your lifeAll over the world they get out of bedLove dies every second
On cold days it isEasy to behave andEasy to believe in itOn cold days it isEasy to see clear andEasy to believe in itYou say winter's killing youThat you can't stand the seasonIt has no smell or flavorI left the city for youThere was no other reasonI did your wife a favourYou're safer with me hereYou're safer with me here
All of us are fallingIt's in everythingHold on to nothingDon't count on anythingThe earth is falling tooIt doesn't stop at nightSee this glass is fallingAnd no I'm not alrightEven the low are fallingEven the lyingAll of us are going down
This is no final solutionNo this is just for todayI'm running from London pollutionStill cold from the rainThese are not perfect conditionsNo this is far from idealThis is a downcast positionAt least it is realIt may be silent but I hear bombs fallI hear sirens down in Whitehall
I'm staring out the worldI'm staring out the streetsI'm staring out the worldHoping she will teachHoping she will tellAll about herselfI'm staring out the world
Half a day behindAnd miles awayI'm on a beachThe only one aroundI know who can'tEnjoy theHeatI bought the postcardNow I have to writeThe wordsI left the countryThere's a chance youMay have heardGrand Cayman is greatOf courseIt is
The morning belongs to the nightUntil it comes with a lightUntil it's born with a sparkUntil it outgrows the darkAnd there it hangs for a momentA breath of hope for a momentStands on its own for a moment

It's easy sometimes when you just coast alongBut like it or not something always seems to go wrongSometimes people build you up just so they can knock you downSometimes they will have you there 'cause they need someone aroundPerhaps you'll receive invitations for teaPerhaps you'll laugh and make them all smile
Time is me and I should knowI knew this several months agoI knew more than I do nowFor I've been turned around somehowRelax the world will spin beside itself and suck you inWith threats and hopes beyond compare
The circus is the place for me with bears and clowns and noiseI love the shiny music that descends from overheadGordan knew the moment when the stars all turned aroundBut from that vantage point I frownedIf life were easy and not so fastI wouldn't think about the past
I'm a fountain of bloodIn the shape of a girlYou're the bird on the brimHypnotized by the WhirlDrink me, make me feel realWet your beak in the streamGame we're playing is lifeLove is a two way dreamLeave me now, return tonightTide will show you the wayIf you forget my name
Everybody needs inspirationEverybody needs a songA beautiful melodyWhen the night's so long'Cause there is no guaranteeThat this life is easyYeah, when my world is falling apartWhen there's no light to break up the darkThat's when I, II look at youWhen the wavesAre flooding the shore and I can'tFind my way home anymoreThat's when I, II look at you
Why do I just lie awake and think of youI need some sleepTomorrow I have things to doEverytime I close my eyes I see your faceSo I try to readBut all I do is lose my placeAm I obsessed with you?I do my best not to want youBut I do all the timeI do all the timeI just had to call you up and say hello
I can almost see itThat dream I'm dreamingBut, there's a voice inside my head sayingYou'll never reach itEvery step I'm takingEvery move I make feelsLost with no directionMy faith is shakingBut I, I gotta keep tryingGotta keep my head held highThere's always gonna be another mountainI'm always gonna wanna make it moveAlways gonna be an uphill battleSometimes I'm gonna have to loseAin't about how fast I get thereAin't about what's waiting on the other sideIt's the climb
Oh please Jesus won't you give me a sunnier day?Cause I'm lost and there's no one aroundI lost my baby in the springtimeNow she's gone with the windAnd I won't be glad until your light has comeAnd I won't sleep with my own demonsLord I think you got it wrongAnd I'm tired of waiting for that manI been searching for religionsLord I think you got it wrong
How would you react, in a situation like mine?When all birds they ain't singingI don't know how to say itBut you can go knowSo please girl, go nowYou make me laugh, you make me shiverIsn't that a fabulous scene?Don't be here now don't be here anytimeI'm much wiser now, that's how we walkI saw you in a daydream
I spilled the ink across the page trying to spell your nameSo I fold it up and I flick it outPaper AeroplaneIt wont fly the seven seas to youCause it didnt leave my roomBut it awaits the hands of someone elseThe garbage manGot to say mmm mmm mmm So he opens it up and reads it out to all his friends
How was I to know that this was always only just a little game to you?All the time I felt you gave your heartI thought that I would do the same for youTell the truth I think I should have seen it coming from a mile awayWhen the words you say are"Baby I'm a fool who thinks it's cool to fall in love"If I gave a thought to fascination
Your eyes maybe wholeBut the story I'm toldIs your heart is as black as nightYour lips maybe sweetSuch that I can't competeBut your heart is as black as nightI don't know why it came along
Deep within your heart, you know it's plain to seeLike Adam was to Eve, you were made for meThey say the poisoned vine breeds a finer wineOur love is easyIf you ask me plainly I would glady sayI'd like to have you round just for them rainy daysI like the touch of your hand, the way you make no demandsOur love is easyOur love is easyLike water rushing over stoneOh, our love is easy, like no love I've ever known
Birds may cease to spread their wingsBut it don't matterBut it don't matterWhen does May envelop springBut it don't matterBut it don't matter, cuzWhen I'm with youMy whole world stands stillYou're my one and only thrillShips may never leave the dock,But it don't matter
Deep within the corners of my mindI keep a memory of your facesAnd I only pull it out when I long for your embraceDeep within the corners of my mindI'm haunted by your smileAs it promises me joys like a journey to a tropic isle
Something by the way he touched meWas so slowThe way he'd put his arms around meEven thoughI'm feeling lonelyI'm feeling lonelyDon't understand the words he said
While the seasons will undo your soulTime forgives us and it takes controlSeparate our things to put us back togetherWe're light as a featherHeavy as the weatherIf it was raining stones
If I touched myselfThe way you touched meIf I could hold myselfThe way you held meThen I wouldn't need youNo, I wouldn't need youNo, I wouldn't need youTo love meIf I could replace
You've ruined me nowBut I liked itBut I'm ruinedDo you have a plan'Cause I'm in your handsYou've ruined me nowThough I liked itNow, I'm ruinedI had no choiceWhen I heard your voiceI know you said"Can't be misled"Now I'm the oneWhose face is red
I'll go back to ManhattanAs if nothin' ever happenedWhen I cross that bridgeIt'll be as if this don't existI have a prince who is waitingAnd a kingdom downtownI'll go back to ManhattanAs if nothing ever happened
You shove your wayThrough the room from the streetAnd finally to meYou ask me what I'm drinkingMy friend JohnnyTugging on my sleeveAsks if I wanna leaveBut what I'm really thinking isWhy can't it be easyEasyWhy don't you leaveLeave meLeave me beI can see you swaying

I used to be a rolling stone you knowIf the cause was rightI'd leave, to find the answer on the roadI used to be a heart beating for someoneBut the times have changedThe less I say the more my work gets done'Cause I live and breathe this Philadelphia freedomFrom the day that I was born, I've waved the flagPhiladelphia freedom took me knee high to a man, yeahGave me peace of mind my daddy never hadOh, Philadelphia freedom, shine on meI love you, shine a lightThrough the eyes of the ones left behindShine a light, shine a lightShine a light, won't you shine a lightPhiladelphia freedom, I love you, yes I doIf you choose to you can live your life alone
When I think of those east end lightsMuggy nights the curtains drawnIn the little room downstairsPrima donna Lord you really should have been thereSittin' like a princess perched in her electric chairAnd it's one more beer and I don't hear you anymoreWe've all gone crazy latelyMy friend's out there rolling 'round the basement floor(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh...)And someone saved my life tonightSugar bear (sugar bear...)You almost had your hooks in meDidn't you dearYou nearly had me roped and tiedAltar bound hypnotized sweet freedomWhispered in my earYou're a butterflyAnd butterflies are free to flyFly awayHigh awayBye bye(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh...)Never realized the passing hours of evening showersSlip noose hanging in my darkest dreamsI'm strangled by your haunted social sceneJust a pawn outplayed by a dominating queenIt's four o'clock in the morningDamn it listen to me goodI'm sleeping with myself tonight
Don't wish it awayDon't look at it like it's foreverBetween you and meI could honestly sayThat things can only get betterAnd while I'm awayDust out the demons insideAnd it won't be longBefore you and me runTo the place in our heartsWhere we hideAnd I guess that's why they call it the bluesTime on my hands could be time spent with youLaughin' like children, livin' like loversRollin' like thunder under the coversAnd I guess that's why they call it the blues
Guess there are times when we all needTo share a little painAnd ironin' out the rough spotsIs the hardest part when memories remainAnd it's times like theseWhen we all need to hear the radio'Cause from the lips of some old singerWe can share the troubles we already knowTurn 'em on, turn 'em onTurn on those sad songsWhen all hope is gone (Ah)Why don't you tune in and turn them on?They reach into your room, oh-oh-ohJust feel their gentle touch (Gentle touch)When all hope is gone (Ooh)Sad songs say so muchIf someone else is suffering enoughOh, to write it downWhen every single word makes senseThen it's easier to have those songs around
I believe in love, it's all we gotLove has no boundaries, costs nothing to touchWar makes money, cancer sleepsCurled up in my father and that means something to meChurches and dictators, politics and papersEverything crumbles sooner or laterBut love, I believe in loveI believe in love, it's all we got
I want love, but it's impossibleA man like me, so irresponsibleA man like me is dead in placesOther men feel liberatedI can't love, shot full of holesDon't feel nothing, I just feel coldDon't feel nothing, just old scarsToughening up around my heartBut I want love, just a different kindI want love, won't break me downWon't brick me up, won't fence me inI want a love, that don't mean a thingThat's the love I want, I want love
Who wants to be right as rainIt's better when something is wrongYou get excitement in your bonesAnd everything you do's a gameWhen night comes and you're on your ownYou can say I chose to be aloneWho wants to be right as rainIt's harder when you're on top'Cause when hard work don't pay offAnd I'm tired there ain't no room in my bedAs far as I'm concernedSo wipe that dirty smile offWe won't be making upI've cried my heart outAnd now I've had enough of loveWho wants to be riding highWhen you'll just crumble back on downYou give up everything you areAnd even then you don't get farThey make believe that everything

Well, me an' my lady had our first big fightSo I drove around 'til I saw the neon lightA corner bar, an it just seemed rightSo I pulled upNot a soul around but the old bar keepDown at the end an' looking half asleepAn he walked up, an' said: "What'll it be?"I said: "The good stuff"He didn't reach around for the whiskeyHe didn't pour me a beerHis blue eyes kinda went mistyHe said: "You can't find that here"'Cause it's the first long kiss on a second dateMomma's all worried when you get home lateAnd droppin' the ring in the spaghetti plate
Got on board a westbound seven forty sevenDidn't think before deciding what to doOoh, that talk of opportunities, TV breaks and moviesRang true, sure rang trueSeems it never rains in southern CaliforniaSeems I've often heard that kind of talk beforeIt never rains in California, but girl don't they warn yaIt pours, man it poursOut of work, I'm out of my head

Another year is gone so fastAnother life becomes the pastUnder the weight of dreamsThat I never thought would lastFeelings clashAnd set a light across the globeThis window seat becomes my homeI lie awake for hoursStaring at the world belowInto the ways again I goHolding on to youI found a way to make it throughBy holding on to youAnother night has slipped awayWishing the time would let me stayStuck in between two lives
I need another storySomething to get off my chestMy life gets kinda boringNeed something that I can confess'Til all my sleeves are stained redFrom all the truth that I've saidCome by it honestly I swearThought you saw me wink, noI've been on the brinkSo tell me what you want to hearSomething that will light those earsI'm sick of all the insincereSo I'm gonna give all my secrets awayThis timeDon't need another perfect lieDon't care if critics ever jump in lineI'm gonna give all my secrets awayMy God, amazing how we got this farIt's like we're chasing all those stars
No sleep todayCan't even rest when the suns downNo timeThere's not enoughAnd nobody's watching me nowWhen we were children we'd playOut in the streets just dipped in fate
For those days we felt like a mistakeThose times when love's what you hateSomehowWe keep marchin' onFor those nights when I couldn't be thereI've made it harder to know that you knowThat somehowWe'll keep movin' onThere's so many wars we foughtThere's so many things we're notBut with what we have, I promise you thatWe're marchin' onWe're marchin' onWe're marchin' onFor all of the plans we've madeThere isn't a flag I'd waveDon't care if we bend, I'd sink us to swimWe're marchin' onWe're marchin' onWe're marchin' onFor those doubts that swirl all around usFor those lives that tear at the seams
I walk alone tonightI feel so cold insideAs I call out your nameFor the last timeAnother picture frameBroken and thrown awayBut the memory of youNever fadesWhen your timing isn't rightYou can feel it every timeFrom the words you couldn't sayTo the stupid games we playDo we dare to cross that lineJust to do it one more timeIs it worth the pain to get lost againIf we know that it's not right
I look around and see my wonderful lifeAlmost perfect from the outsideIn picture frames, I see my beautiful wifeAlways smiling, but on the insideOh, I can hear her sayingLead me with strong handsStand up when I can'tDon't leave me hungry for loveChasing dreams but what about usShow me you're willing to fightThat I'm still the love of your lifeI know we call this our homeBut I still feel alone
So shut up!You can't see inside of meFeedin' the public lies & bullshitTryin' to break me, you'll never break meI never wanted any of thisInterrogate me just like criminal that's being held in custodyAnd try to break me open like an eggshell motherfucker
Teach me to number my daysAnd count every momentBefore it slips awayTake in all the colorsBefore they fade to greyI don't want to missEven just a secondMore of thisIt happens in a blink, it happens in a flashIt happens in the time it took to look backI try to hold on tight, but there's no stopping timeWhat is it I've done with my life?It happens in a blinkIt happens in a blinkWhen it's all said and doneNo one remembers
You fear the lessonAnd fear to walkAnd fear to pass onYour fear to talkThe teacher was fearedYour parents tooThen you becameThe fear of youFear
What do you want of meWhat do you long from meA slim Pixie, thin and forlornA count, white and drawnWhat do you make of meWhat can you take from mePallid landscapes off my frownLet me rip you up and downFor you I came to forsake
San Francisco song(Keep it clean EP - 2004)You know I cannot stand your love for alcoholYou're such a tall man but you're looking kind of small
For your birthday she sent you a cardShe didn't sign her name she gave an autographNow she's trying to call your bluffShe your true love?We knew the boy who went from Mod to TedShe asked matter of fact had he gone off his headHe was uncomplaining as a treeNot a thing like me

Through early morning fog I seeVisions of the things to beThe pains that are withheld for meI realize and I can seeThat suicide is painlessIt brings on many changesAnd I can take or leave it if I pleaseThe game of life is hard to playI'm going to lose it anywayThe losing card I'll someday laySo this is all I have to say
Blue skies are in the middle of a winter stormWhile your blue eyes are looking at me like beforeStill those blue skies are in the middle of a winter stormWhile your blue eyes are looking at me like beforeI find youI find you happy for todayI mind youI mind you ever going to stayBlue skies are in the middle of a winter stormWhile your blue eyes are looking at me like before
A sisters social agonyYou bruise like a cherry my darling girlWords can mean nothing to some in this worldI want you to know I thought about you last nightI cried
No sense no styleI said I loved you for a little whileWhen you cried noHigh speed became go slowCome back this time
My friend she told me such a story but she didn't know what I knewI laughed with my friend when she got to the endI knew we were laughing at youShe told me that you made some money and you got yourself frames on the wallPeople come by and they look at your faceAnd they say it's the fairest of allOf course you protest
You can compliment me on the style of my hairGive me marks out of ten for the clothes I wearYou probably thought I had more upstairsAnd I disappoint you, I can see through your perfect smileHe likes to read books written for girlsHe prides himself on being a man of the worldIn the darkest places he gets his thrillsHe will disappoint you if you see through his perfect smile

What would you say if I asked of you- Out of loneliness, out of lonelinessWhat would you say if I asked of you- Out of loneliness, out of lonelinessCould I be with youCan I be with youIt's warm inside the night clubYour face is lit up by a disco lightI don't want to go home alone, not tonightI have a picture of a man who used to sit in that chair
You know that I would love to see you next yearI hope that I am still alive next yearYou magnify the way I think about myselfBefore you came I rarely thought about myselfBehind your veil I found a body underneathInside your head were things I never thought aboutYou know that I would love to see you next yearI hope that I am still alive next yearWhat's my view?Well how am I supposed to know?Write a reviewWell how objective can I be?What's my view?Well how am I supposed to know?Write a reviewWell how objective can I be?You know that I would love to see you in that dressI hope that I will live to see you undressedThe every day is part of what consumes meThe hate I feel is part of what fuels meI testify to having guilty feelings
Thinking clearly never came as easy as it did for youDriving this route out of town I wish you were still aroundIn the dead of night I always wondered whether you were trueSomeone better than myself an offer you just can't turn downA morning fight, A wasted nightYou crept back to your room...Run along back to your new man, LimassolHold on, I couldn't trap youWe're gonna head for... new horizons, Limassol
Put away hard to findI don't remember why I started speakin'Fast track operationSlow exertion, overriddenUnseen tough to catchI cant remember why I started drinkin'One track mind each and every timeSpeed exertion, country livingEngage the men in trustI cant remember why I started hurtin'Another street light going downThe night reveals itself to youSlipping under, sliding downAll I need is a certain triggerThe path you take will never make you happyAll I need is a certain spurOnce a glimpse was all I needed
You've got to catch an early planeAnd it's no surprise I'm standing stillAnother minute more is all I needAnd I'll never have enoughThis room gets so cold in the winterWhat will it take to heat this house?I just want to feel comfortableWhen there's only the two of us on my bedMy foot nearly brushes your legI can't draw it away; I can't push it forwardIt lies stranded. It belongs to someone else.We knew each other onceThis can't be what you want.But you didn't have to demolish me.
I know the night has reached that stage againWhere I never want to see my homeI know that you'll provide the brainsBut who'll provide the brawn?And if it comes down to me and himYou know I'd kiss you better...I kept the message that you sent to meBear with me...If you're scared
Yeah you,Look at meLook in my eyesLook at me(Oh)Look at meLook in my eyesThe soul within will tell you no liesI am youYou are me
I found the fragance separate from the flowerIn all the logic I was lostI found the fair light blossom to be sourAnd beneath the soil, the real costYou came to me

I'm not pygmalionHooked by failureRuled as a juvenileAged as an infantileSubject to the ladderRuined by affectionExcepted by exceptionPredicted on a graphCornered by ritualDiminished by impressionCried out in the lessonSubject to the ladderSubject to the ladderMy thoughts are coming throughEmptiness follows tooA cyclone full on feeling
Some things are worth the bruisesSome things are worth the hurtI like the way your face looks towards meTry just a little harderTry and make this time for meI like the way your glances deceive meI gave myself awayAnd yes, I meant to give you warningBut what did I sayYou can call me in the morning
We got found out now I can't see you anymoreAnd I don't want to hear your voice againNow I don't know what I can do with all these wordsI've hidden all your photographs awayI put my guard up when I hear of things you've doneI'll never see your eyes againNow all the things you've dropped before meFall lifeless to the floorI can't be there to catch you anymoreIn shallow water you still drown
I rewrite my life, beneath moonlightPlease hold me now, till my breath runs outThere are many things, that I am notBut there's one thing that, I can't denyA double bluff, you fed me linesThe shortest cut, you're searching forA mesh of tones, surround your eyesI wish I knew, how it came to thisI always said you could rely on meNow it seems that I was wrongI want you to stayI want you to stay with me'Cause nothing works 'round hereWhere cranes collect the sky
Night fallsAnd towns become circuit boardsWe can beat the sun as long as we keep movingFrom the airStadium lights stand out like flaresAnd all I know is that you're sat here right next to meWe rarely seeWarning signs in the air we breatheRight now I feel each and every fragmentThis paper trail leads right back to youYou say you need me to step outsideYou spent the evening unpacking books from boxesYou passed me up so as not to break a promiseScattered polaroids and sprinkled words around your collarIn the long run, you said you knew that this would happen
Modern architectureAlready left to decayYou don't know what you're breathing inWhat it is, I couldn't sayWe'll meet in Russian LiteratureFourth Floor middayTravelling Trans-PennineShe said she'd wait.More empty buildings for invisible menNo market value to justify the price of the rentIgnorance isn't bliss,Familiarity still ends in contemptWe're gonna need some time
You write a list of things to doTo occupy the time that you could useBut in my mind it's never finalAnd when you sleep, I try not to wake you as I leaveOh, I waited up for youBut you didn't come back homeOh, I waited up for youCouldn't you come back home?If someone gets run downKaraoke plays somewhere in the backgroundBut there is no explanationWhat makes a grown man cry?Karaoke plays and someone gets run down
You don't have to deny your urgeIt doesn't make you bad.On our admission the makeweight liftedStop dwelling on the past.I think about the three of us. I wonder how we tessellateIt would've been much wiser to allow these feelings to abateEmpty words, so free of connotationsAll dreams come to an end.Codify your utterance, communicate your needsPrepare your vocabulary.My nervous system fails me, my thoughts are becoming fugitiveAnd when I'm in your arms, I wonder how much I can giveThe weekend is a GodsendThe night-time is a lifelineAnother useless fumble
The lines of transport make their way through townsThe lines of transport make their way through townsAt any cost, name a priceDigging through townsMake way, like Moses through the wavesPick and choose, from the folklore to describe the biggest eventsDid I make it all up?The tritus gathers, until dirt is the only layer you seeScratch away, scrap awayLacerateKeep scratching!Have we become the unshockable orHave we become this saddened?Activities absolute, and things are looking scarce!The human heart is on trial for a limited spellThe human heart is on offer for a limited spell
You said you'd like to see me againAnd then it all unravelledI heard that you were seeing someoneNot such an insignificant otherIt seems my moves were far too swiftIn life some things are worth the effortI touched the place where your hair had beenI buttoned the shirt that you left 'round mineDefacing pictures of famous people on the trainStanding by the Monument just waiting for the rainIn my wallet with your photobooth smile,
You were born in winter, but summer came too fastLike a child you can't control, now isn't it obvious?That you still value his word, now that it's not thereYou ask another question, now isn't it obvious?Some people hide their emotions, and some people show too muchI'm aiming for somewhere central, now isn't it obvious?He changed his look for youYou changed your life for himNow, was the verdict worth the trial?
Parisian skiesShadows beneath your eyesAll we have now(And the arc of your brow)You came to leave these shoresAn inkling in your poresWe came to bid farewellThe tears began to swellOh, I don't think she knewI can't forget herThe dark withholdsAnd lives unfoldWe always slept so wellOur bodies seemed to gel
In pastures blue and greenI'll follow you and you'll follow meMy fabric's mysteryI'll wave your loyalty in the freezing breeze so desperatelyOh and another one comes downAnother one comes downAnother one comes downI think I see my lifeHe bows all slyly and gentle-likeHe's never had the rightBut I've never lived without his sad and jealous eyesOh and another one comes down
Home, is this a quiet place where you should be alone?Is this where the tortured and the troubled find their own?I don't know, but I can tell this isn't you, your cover's blownBut oh no, don't you dare hang up this phoneHey! Give me space so I can breatheGive me space so I can sleepGive me space so you can drown in this with meIn this placeThe lonely escapade in outer spaceThere's no anecdote for irony
I woke up in new york cityFrom my sleep behind the wheelCaught a train to poughkeepsieAnd time stood stillShe wrote me a letter from san diegoTo qualify her luckThese flights connect through arizonaBut I think I'll stay stuckSo here I amHere I amWell I woke up in a carI traced away the fogSo I could see the mississippi on her kneesI've never been so lostI've never felt so much at homePlease write my folks and throw away my keysI woke up in a carI woke up in a car
This is the only lonely pictureWaiting on my floorLittering my shoreThis is the last true burning letterGiven to a girlWritten by a boyLiving in a world created to destroyBut if I built you a city, would you let meWould you tear it down?But there you go for the last timeI finally know now what I should have known thenThat I could still be ruthless if you'll let meBut there you go and I'm not doneYou're waving goodbye, but at least you're having funThe rising tide will not let you forget me
Let's get drunk, you can drive us to the harborWish upon a star, but do you know what stars are?Balls of fire burning up the black spaceFalling from the landscapeExploding in the Face of GodLet's get crazy, talk about our big plansPlaces that you're going, places that I haven't beenBuild my walls up, concrete castleKeep this kingdom free of hassles
Your grand dad left home for the circusHe was young just like me,With hope to exploreHe married a girl in VirginiaShe could swing the trapeze,They could sleep on the floorYour mother was born in December,On the one sunny day that winter gave upWith warm summer eyes that flickered like fireflies,And she stared at the worldSo why do you leave these stories unfinished,My Cheshire cat doorstop with tears in your eyes?
I've been sleeping with ghostsI've been watching starsCrawling out of the skyAnd I've been hopingI'm close to the space man moviesI call my lifeAnd I've been climbing ladders through timeI've got tunnel visionBut I'm doing fineAnd I've beenWatching stars coming off of the wallAnd maybe if I'm lucky I can catch themBefore you fallAnd you are not aloneCalling out to the astronautI need some of what you've gotI need to be highCrawling out of the world she brought
On Christmas morningOutside was pouringAll was hopeless in this homeBut no one's speakingAnd no one creepingTo see if she was on the phoneAnd you were quietThis routine riotIs all but practical to meAnd if we see itWhy can't we beat itCan we let each other be?Forget DecemberIt won't be betterThan I remember it beforeAnd this month onlyWill be so lonelyBut not so Holy anymoreNew Years Eve came
I want some red roses for a blue ladyMr. Florist, take my order, pleaseWe had a silly quarrel the other dayI hope these pretty flowers chase her blues awayI want some red roses for a blue ladySend them to the sweetest gal in town
You wanted a hit but maybe we don't do hitsI try and try, it ends up feeling kind of wrongYou wanted it tough but is it ever tough enough?No, nothing's ever tough enough until we hit the roadYeah, you wanted it lush but honestly you must hushNo honestly you know too much so leave us, leave us on our ownAnd so you wanted a hit, well, this is how we do hitsYou wanted the hit but that's not what we doYou wanted it real but can you tell me what's real?There's lights and sounds and stories, music's just a partYeah, you wanted the truth and then you said you want proofI guess you're used to liars saying what they wantAnd we won't be your babies anymore
Home, home, homeHome, home, homeTake me homeJust do it rightMake it perfect and realBecause it's everythingThough everything was never the dealSo grab your thingsAnd stumble into the nightSo we can shut the doorAnd shut the door on terrible times, ohYeah, do it rightAnd head again into spaceSo you can carry on and carry onAnd fall all over the placeThis is the trick
The Heart's Lonley Hunter LyricsThe Truth is unspoken, a promise is brokenI'm under surveillance, they know what my name isI need some protection, some love and affectionThere's 1000 reasons, but one is the numberWelcome to my spaceshipIt's beautiful foreverShe's right here where you left herAnd the heart's lonely hunterSave bottles of water and flour and sugarTurn off the AC and hang up the bed sheetsCover up windows, careful where the light goesYank out the cable and blow out the candle
Wadin' through the waste stormy winterAnd there's not a friend to help you throughTryin' to stop the waves behind your eyeballsDrop your reds, drop your greens and bluesThank you for your wine, CaliforniaThank you for your sweet and bitter fruitsYes I got the desert in my toenail
Danny and ISpent anther late night over pancakesWe talked about soccerAnd how every man's just the sameWe made speculationOn the who's and the when's of our futuresAnd how everyone's lonelyBut still we just couldn't complainAnd how we just hate being aloneCould I have missed my only chanceAnd now I'm just wasting my timeBy lookin' around
Out on these Texas plainsYou can see for a million livesAnd there's a thousand exitsBetween here and the state lineAbout the last time that I saw youYou said call me Pandora, call me a foolAnd I'm thinking this viewIt could do you some goodSo drop these scales and take a lookThere's 40 acresAnd redemption to be foundJust along and down the wayThere is a place whereNo plow blade has turned the groundAnd you will turn it over'Cause out here hope remains'Cause out here hope remainsOut here the Texas sky
You're softer than a cannon blastBut your effects much longer lastAnd I want you just like a hole in my headBut I need you like a meal and a bedAnd you say, "Come on, I'm not what you're after"But I know you're not just anyone, anyone'Cause I'm not what you wantNo, I'm not anyoneBut if you needed meThen I could be someoneAnd you're an army in a horse
My name is MaryAnd I'm from Greenville, MississippiYeah but this is where I liveHere in this old folks' dormitoryAnd every Sunday nightSarah comes to see usAnd she plays that old uprightBut Sarah always seems to leave usAnd when she playsSomething comes over meGoes from my headAll the way to my feetAnd I wanna danceI wanna snap my fingers all night long and danceI wanna move around the room just like a woman in a tranceAll night, I said I wanna danceI wanna wrap my arms around your neck and danceI wanna listen to the music that's been ringin' in my ears
Shoot a dream in your arm and sleep away,It's not the stuff that kills you that keeps your life at bay.Every crash pulls you in reach,Of a watershed of signal flares that cover your beach,These are just placebos to make us feel all right,Illusions in our pockets make our feathers float us high,For a second I thought I saw your eyelids rise,For a moment something restless caught you by surprise,
Catch the rain empty hands,Save the children from their lands,Wash the darkness from their skin.Heroes from the West,We don't know you, we know best.But this is not a test.You treat me like I'm blind, setting fires around houses on the hill,But light gives heat.You segregate my mind, burning crosses from your fears, your fears,
I am the only one to blame for thisSomehow it all ends up the sameSoaring on the wings of selfish pride, flew too highAnd like a chorus, I collideWith a world I try so hard to leave behindTo rid myself of all but loveTo give and dieTo turn away and not becomeAnother nail to pierce the skin of One who lovedMore deeply than the oceans, more abundant than the tearsOf a world embracing every heartacheAnd can I be the one to sacrifice?Or grip the spear and watch the blood and water flow?(To love You) Take my world apart(To need You) I am on my knees(To love You) Take my world apart(To need You) Broken on my kneesAll said and done, I stand aloneAmongst remainings of a life I should not ownTakes all I am to believe
Rain rain on my faceHasn't stopped raining for daysMy world is a floodSlowly I become one with the mudBut if I can't swim after forty daysAnd my mind is crushed by the crashing wavesLift me up so high that I cannot fallLift me ohLift me up - When I'm fallingLift me up - I'm weak and I'm dyingLift me up - I need you to hold meLift me up - Keep me from drowning againDownpour on my soul
If you insist on pictures of shorelinesThen i insist on pages of your linesMeant for me, to be sent to me.Remember watching the storms from the lifeguard standRemember the tingling in my fingertipsWhen i touch your lipsAnd i recall how you sat on the same side of meYou know it seems that you'd always be on my sideYou're my best side.And it's early June so the sand's still dry
When you got thereI was sure you'd come too lateWe all paid you lip serviceThan address our prayers to fateSister goneShe tripped and fellA prodigal hellAnd do I dare believe you'll reachSuch a long lost causeWrapped in gauzeAs good as deadShe's breathingMy lordShe's a miracle childI know

Peace takes a taxi to the undergroundI wanna love the world, but I don't know howI blame it on the DJ playing all the fast songsAin't spinnin' anything I can sing alongSo if you know the words, then try to sing alongAnd when you get the beat, grab a hammer, bang a gong'Cause you don't got to fight or make yourself belongTo be a revolution, yeahTo be a revolution, yeahIf you wanna learn to play the rock guitarThen throw down your guns, you gotta be a starYou gotta begin with who you know you are
It was the fear of God that led me to youAnd it's the fear of you that takes getting used toI've never been one to hang my heart on a threadBut you spun me around and you loved me insteadI know I could turn to something other than you
Sunny days keepin' the clouds awayI think we're coming to a clearing and a brighter daySo far away, still I think they say, the wait will make their heartGrow stronger or fonder, I can't quite remember anywaySo if you're waitin' for love, well it's a promise I'll keepIf you don't mind believing that it changes everythingTime will never matterWinter, spring is what love can truly bringIce turns to water, water flows to everythingYou can lose your mind, maybe then your heart will findI hope you won't give up what's movin' you inside, no
I'm here waitingFor something new to break my heartSo callous laden, that I can't feel a thing at allSo will You catch my fall?From lost and not found, to run and not hideMy hand inside... Your handLosing my gripFalling so farMY hand inside...
Convinced of my deceptionI've always been a foolI fear this love reactionJust like you said I wouldA rose could never lieAbout the love it bringsAnd I could never promiseTo be any of those thingsIf I was not so weakIf I was not so cold
Dear God, surround me as I speakThe bridges that I walk across are weakFrustrations fill the voidThat I can't solely bearDear God, don't let me fall apartYou've held me close to youI have turned away and searchedFor answers I can't understandThey say that I can move the mountainsAnd send them falling to the seaThey say that I can walk on waterIf I would follow and believeWith faith like a child
This is for all the lonely peopleThinkin' that life has passed them byDon't give up until you drink from the silver cupRide that highway in the skyThis is for all the single people
WavorlyTime I UnderstoodAs I'm building up this houseI wonder what of it will stayIt seems You just take things awayAnd I'll admit I shouldn't say these thingsBut I have got to hear from You somehowDoes this have a point to it?God, I wish I could hear YouYou said You'd help me through this
Watch you when you sayWhat you are and when you blameEveryone, you broken kingWatch you change the frame orWatch you when you take your aimAt the sum of everything'Cause You and Your HeartShouldn't feel so far apartYou can choose what you takeWhy you gotta break and make it feel so hard
What do you want them all to see?A blind man with blind faith is he your fuckin enemy?All he wants to do is survive this painful cancer.You should be looking for the answer now.And as the silence breaks.Give him what he can take.And he finds it hard to be alone.And as the silence breaks give him what he can take: a way out.Why don't you set it aside cos he's got nothing to hide you just put him down.
I've been looking so long at these pictures of youThat I almost believe that they're realI've been living so long with my pictures of youThat I almost believe that the picturesAre all I can feelRemembering you standing quiet in the rainAs I ran to your heart to be nearAnd we kissed as the sky fell inHolding you closeHow I always held close in your fearRemembering you running soft through the nightYou were bigger and brighter and whiter than snowAnd screamed at the make-believeScreamed at the sky
Here we stand againAnother day has passed usWith its lack of changeAnd all we have is what we shareAnd all we want is someone else to be thereAnd if the sun will set tonightHold our secrets up to the skyAs our shadows grow there's nothing left to hideAnd if you ever doubtYou will know that I still wonderHow many times did I compareThe stars to your eyesWe will make it throughNo matter the costWe've gone this farWhy not find out how it works outFor you and meWe'll make it throughI thought we were lost
Thinking of the words to say,I'd like to think that this was fate.Reference to a song you love,Spell confusion with a KLike a star without its strings,I'm hanging here on these two wings.For that smile and those eyesI'm fallingIf time could stop, how could I make this more poetic?When there's nothing more pathetic to be saidYou bring me out, show me light,I'm sorry if I hide, I'm too afraid to look inside.You carry through, you make me smile.If it were you and me tonight,I would tame the stars and save the brightest one for you,For you...
This is for the ones who believe their lives wont changeHoping that someday things will mend and be the sameAnd this is for the ones who have lost it allWhen all is left to gainIts a simple reminder that the things that were blind to slip awayHow can i say...Say that ill be okay...And if i fall through these days that go by without a case
I know it's not enough to say I'm wrongYou know that I will miss you now you're goneI know it's not your life to see this throughJust know that in my heart it beats for youSo leave a little note for me behindI swear I have to know the reasons whyThis won't surviveBut if you fall back into my lifeI'd spend every night waking up to the beat I hear insideTelling me to be your only oneBut if you fall back into my life
Can we make this last foreverWith every word we're growing distantAnd I feel as though I have to let you goIt's growing old to see us torn by every choice that I have madeIn every instant you were right to write me off and move aheadAnd I think I let you down, I throw it all awayI never meant to break it up or make you feel this wayIt's getting colder through these walls that seem to thin to break us nowA perfect ending's still in line though it seems our time is running outTrace the call from you, we'll make this go awayI never felt this day would come, I'll never be the sameCan we make this last foreverWith every word you're growing distantAnd I feel as though I have to let you go
I've come to acceptThe fact from my headI'm lost and alone in this life that I've ledI'll figure this outIt's summers awayA choice that may leave me with no room to sayIf it happens it happens and I'll feel the sameCan't hold back on the choices I madeIf it happens it happens and I'll be the sameCan't hold back on the choices I made that day
Thinking of the words to sayI'd like to think that this was fateReference to a song you loveSpell confusion with a "k"Like a star without its stringsI'm hanging here on these two wingsFor that smile and those eyes...(I'm falling)If time could stop, how could I make this more poeticWhen there's nothing more pathetic to be said...?You bring me out, show me lightI'm sorry if I hide, I'm too afraid to look insideYou carry truth, you make me smileIf it were you and me tonightI would tame the stars and save the brightest one for youFor you...

She was a be-bop baby on a hard day's nightShe was hangin' on JohnnyHe was holdin' on tightOh, I could feel her coming from a mile awayThere was no use talkingThere was nothing to sayWhen the band began to play and playAnd we dancedLike a wave on the ocean romancedWe were liars in loveAnd we dancedSwept away for a moment by chanceYeah, we danced and danced and dancedI met my be-bop baby at the Union hallShe could dance all night and shake the paint off the wallBut when I saw her smile across a crowded room
I can still rememberThe words and what they meantAs we etched them with our fingersIn years of wet cementThe days blurred into each otherThough everything seemed clearWe cruised along at half speedBut then we shifted gearsWe ran like vampires from a thousand burning sunsBut even then we should have stayedBut we ran awayNow all my friends are goneMaybe we've outgrown all the things that we once lovedRunawayBut what are we running from?
All we are is entertainmentCaught up in our own derangementTell us what to say and what to doAll we are are pretty facesPicture perfect bottled ragePackaged synthesized versions of youWe've all made petty fortunes, but we can't afford a lifeConfined to pull-out quotes and hotel rooms (hey, hey, hey, hey)They all scream California and its toppling empireBut can't you see the end is coming soonHey
He said "Son, have you seen the world?Well, what would you say if I said that you could?"Just carry this gun, you'll even get paid"I said "That sounds pretty good"Black leather bootsSpit-shined so brightThey cut off my hair but it looked alrightWe marched and we sangWe all became friendsAs we learned how to fightA hero of warYeah, that's what I'll beAnd when I come homeThey'll be damn proud of meI'll carry this flagTo the grave if I must'Cause it's a flag that I loveAnd a flag that I trustI kicked in the doorI yelled my commands

The innocence of sleeping childrenDressed in white and slowly dreamingStops all timeI slow my steps and start to blurSo many years have filled my heartI never thought I'd say those wordsThe further we go, and older we growThe more we know, the less we showThe further we go, and older we growThe more we know, the less we show
Say goodbye on a night like thisIf it's the last thing we ever doYou never looked as lost as thisSometimes it doesn't even look like youIt goes darkIt goes darker still please stayBut I watch you like I'm made of stoneAs you walk awayI'm coming to find you if it takes me all nightA witch hunt for another girlFor always and ever is always for youYour just the most gorgeously stupid thing I ever cut in the world

Don't give up on trustDon't give up on me, on usIf we could just hold on long enough

I want somethingThat's purer than the waterLike we wereIt's not there nowIneloquence and angerAre all we haveLike Saturn's ringsAn icy loop around meToo hard to holdLash out firstAt all the things we don't likeOr understandAnd It's Beginning To Get To MeThat I know more of the stars and seaThan I do of what's in your headBarely touching in our cold bed
For once I want to be the car crashNot always just the traffic jamHit me hard enough to wake meAnd lead me wild to your dark roadsHeadlights before meSo beautiful, so clearReach out and take it
The earth is warm next to my earInsects noise is all that I hearA magic trick makes the world disappearThe skies are dark, they're dark but they're clearA distant motorcade and suddenly there's joy
When faith alone is not enoughTo keep our hands barely aboveWe look for reason and come up empty-handedAnd when our children fight our warsWhile we sit back just keeping scoreWere teaching murder not understanding nowWe're setting the fires to light the wayWe're burning it all to begin againWith hope in our hearts and bricks in our handsWe sing for change
Wake me up insideTell me there's a reasonTake another stepTo get up off my knees andFollow this path of most resistanceWherever it takes usWhatever it faces and wherever it leadsSo wake me when it's throughI don't want to feel the things that you do (the things that you do)Don't worry I'll be fine
Warm yourself by the fire, sonAnd the morning will come soonI'll tell you stories of a better timeIn a place that we once knewBefore we packed our bagsAnd left all this behind us in the dustWe had a place that we could call homeAnd a life no one could touchDon't hold me up nowI can stand my own groundI don't need your help nowYou will let me down, down, downDon't hold me up nowI can stand my own groundI don't need your help nowYou will let me down, down, down, downWe are the angry and the desperateThe hungry, and the coldWe are the ones who kept quietAnd always did what we were told
Deep inside these burning buildingsVoices die to be heardYears we spent teaching a lessonWe ourselves had never learnedAnd if strength is born from heartbreakThen mountains I could moveAnd if walls could speak I'd prayThat they would tell me what to doIf you see me, please just walk on by, walk on byForget my name and I'll forget it too
Chairs thrown and tables toppledHands armed with broken bottlesStanding no chance to win butWe're not running, we're not runningThere's a point I think we're missingIt's in the air we raise our fists inIn the smiles we cast each otherMy sister, my brotherAbout the time we gave up hopingWe never find these locks still openStumbling on stones unturnedThe hurt we feel, we all have earnedThe lines we cross in search of changeBut all they see is treasonAlthough we have no obligationTo stay aliveOn broken backs we beg for mercyWe will survive
Tell me what I'm supposed to doWith all these left over feelings of you'Cause I don't knowAnd tell me how I'm supposed to feelWhen all these nightmares become real'Cause I don't knowAnd I don't think you seeThe places inside me that I find youAnd I don't know how weSeparate the lies here from the truthAnd I don't know how we
In fields where nothing grew but weedsI found a flower at my feetBending there in my directionI wrapped a hand around its stemI pulled until the roots gave inFinding now what I've been missingBut I knowSo I tell myself, I tell myself it's wrongThere's a point we pass from which we can't returnI felt the cold rain of the coming stormAll because of youI haven't slept in so longWhen I do I dream of drowning in the oceanLonging for the shore where I can lay my head downI'll follow your voiceAll you have to do is shout it out
Somewhere between happyAnd total fucking wreckFeet sometimes on solid groundSometimes at the edgeTo spend your waking momentsSimply killing timeIs to give up on your hopes and dreamsTo give up on yourLife for you has been less than kindSo take a number, stand in lineWe've all been sorry, we've all been hurtBut how we surviveIs what makes us who we areAn obvious disinterestA barely managed smileA deep nod in agreementA status quo exile
Breathe deep and easySwallow this prideStare at my shaking hands through bone dry, bloodshot eyesClock strip the hoursI count the milesWill you be there waitingAwake until sunrise?I've traveled in darknessFor what seems like days, ICrawl from the sinkholesCollapsed under this weightI know not your sorrowBut I know mineSo say you'll stay and dance with me tonight
Two girls for every boyI bought a '30 Ford wagon and we call it a woody(Surf City, here we come)You know it's not very cherry, it's an oldie but a goody(Surf City, here we come)Well, it ain't got a back seat or a rear windowBut it still gets me where I wanna goAnd we're goin' to Surf City, 'cause it's two to oneYou know we're goin' to Surf City, gonna have some funYa, we're goin' to Surf City, 'cause it's two to oneYou know we're goin' to Surf City, gonna have some fun, nowTwo girls for every boy

Dirty your faceWith longing and grace, God-givenSuffer her heartAnd love her when your love goes unrequitedWhere the cool winds blowI must surely goFor my love calls me below to drag herFrom the depths of my soulWhen will I see her again?The other side of friendsThe darkened claws of death
Gone, long goneBlink and I'll be gone, gone, goneLeave this world of wrong, wrong, wrongLeave it far behindAnd although my secret's goneI'll try to carry onIf I must, I'll get alongWithout youGone, long goneLeave this world of wrong, wrong, wrong
Day is endingBirds are wendingBack to their shelter ofEach little nest they loveNightshade's fallingLovebirds callingWhat makes the world go roundNothing but loveWhen whippoorwills callAnd evening is night
Close your eyesUntil the sunlight diesIn your head a thousand starsThrough the darkness you can see a lightAnd if they steal your lifeYour heart is still mineI want to believe in you and I heard youYour song, you sing, a truth, there's no otherI want to believe in you, dearOn Sunday...There's a life I hide
I spin off and lose my headThrowing stray a spark insteadGather strength down in my heelAnd dig it in the world I peelWay down deep within my heartLies a soul that's torn apartTell me, tell me what you're afterI just want to get there faster

Howling tracks of hell they're coming, black storm on the riseThey fill our temples with their liesThe snakes come slitheringAnarchyChaotic hunters riseSpit in their evil eyesStand our ground with hate and fury, fear that comes will dieOur enemies have come to life

The day I learn to flyI'm never coming downOn perfect wings I'll riseThrough the layers of the cloudsAnd from there I see the neon grids of citiesWhere six million people that keep their fires litAnd I threw a party in my nameBut the hours crawled by and no one cameSo I bowed my head and I prayed for wings

They told me if I write this song for them.That they would cut my hair for free.But that's not me no liberties.They're in to all the coolest bandsAnd knowing that they're going to the gigs as fansEntitles me to some decency.Astedwae ittlae ejaysdaeThey're the cleverest blonde weekend.Astedwae ittlae ejaysdaeI WISH everybody danced like them.Split visions of a talkative therapyIt makes me bend away it gives me ESeems hard to say, its insanity.
I felt I was one with you,You probably didn't see,Oh I'm a nervous one,My pain it comes easily.Should I revolve my world around you,Should I revolve my light around you,Claudia, Claudia,You're taunting you're teasing,You know I have feelings too,
Hey dad, I'm writing to youNot to tell you that I still hate youJust to ask you how you feelAnd how we fell apartHow this fell apartAre you happy out there in this great wide world?Do you think about your sons?Do you miss your little girl?When you lay your head downHow do you sleep at night?Do you even wonder if we're alright?But we're alrightWe're alrightIt's been a long hard road without you by my sideWhy weren't you there all the nights that we cried?You broke my mother's heart, you broke your children for lifeIt's not ok but we're alright
Time...You found time enough to loveAnd I found love enough to hold youSo tonight.I'll stir the fire you feel insideUntil the flames of love enfold youLaying beside you, lost in the feelingSo glad you opened my doorCome with me.Somewhere in the night we will knowEverything lovers can knowYou're my song.
Ridin' in the bus down the boulevardAnd the place was pretty packed, yeahCouldn't find a seat so I had to standWith the perverts in the backIt was smellin' like a locker roomThere was junk all over the floorWe're already packed in like sardinesBut we're stoppin' to pick up more, look outAnother one rides the bus, another one rides the busAnother comes on and another comes onAnother one rides the busHey, he's gonna sit by you, another one rides the busThere's a suitcase pokin' me in the ribs
I wanted your love, but look what it's done to meAll my dreams have come to nothingWho would have believedAll the laughter that we shared would be a memoryI cannot count the tears you've cost meIf I could have seenAnd do you ever think of me?And how we used to be?Oh, I know you're somewhere else right nowLoving someone else, no doubtWell, I'm one for sorrow, ain't it too, too badAre you breaking someone else's heart?'Cause you're taking my love where you areWell, I'm one for sorrow, ain't it too, too bad 'bout usI wanted your love but I got uncertainty
When two lovers meet in Mayfair, so the legends tell,Songbirds sing; winter turns to spring.Every winding street in Mayfair falls beneath the spell.I know such enchantment can be, 'cos it happened one evening to me:That certain night, the night we met,There was magic abroad in the air,There were angels dining at the Ritz,And a nightingale sang in Berkeley Square.I may be right, I may be wrong,But I'm perfectly willing to swear
He tends to get carried awayLike a talk show he's got drama everydayLots of rage and mental abusingThe way he treats me it's obvious he's confusingMe for some dumb bitchWho will stick aroundI tend to stick aroundYouTell me that you love me if it's trueWhy am i runnin from you and whoAre these bitches on my answering machineYeah you, you tell me that you love me but booIf this is loveIt's a good thing you don't hate meSuperflySomeone who'll at least tryWho'll smoke me out from time to timeAnd love me all nite
Looking back on the memory ofThe dance we shared beneath the stars aboveAnd for a moment all the world was rightHow could I have known that you'd ever say goodbyeAnd now I'm glad I didn't knowThe way it all would end, the way it all would goOur lives are better left to chanceI could've missed the painBut I'd have had to miss the dance

When she passes me by, she's a ray of light.Like the first drop of sun from the sky.And I know she's a queen who deserves a king.But I'm not a king, and she doesn't see me.When she dances, she moves me to a smile.I see everything near her shine.There is a grace in her ways I can't contain.I don't have the grace, she doesn't see me.
Have you seen your sunsetFade beneath a raincloudHave you ever chased you dreams awayDid you ever think thatLife was just a highwayA never ending road of lonely daysThere are times we cryAnd reach out to the skyFor the strength we needTo hold our head up highAll we have to do nowIs love one anotherSisters and brothersCan all live as oneAnd all we have to do nowIs show one anotherWe all need each otherTo live as one in love
You don't even hold me like you used to hold meAnd there's no way you could've meant all the things you told meYeah, yeahI remember when you told me you'd never lie to meI can't believe I trusted youI sacrificed my time and my heartI gave you my all and what do you doYou stepped on me, you walked on meAnd boy you left yourFootprints on myHeart broken crying over the way you left yourFootprints on myHeart aching you ran all over me and left yourFootprints on my heartMy heartI know the way you were berfore meAnd I was crazy to think you'd changeI put up with your attitude
In times of despair, I think about the good things that you've doneAnd though you're not there, I sometimes ask myself, is anyone?It's hard being human, when the whole world's uptightBut somehow I knowThat everything's gonna work out all rightI might lose my patience, but won't you please try to understand
I'm standing here looking in the mirrorSaying, "Damn" to myselfI should have known the day would comeThat she would find somebody elseAnd all the things I took her throughShit, I shouldn't have lasted this longNow I'm at this telephone booth calling Tyrone'Cause when a woman's fed upNo matter how you beg, noIt ain't nothing you can do about it (nothing you can do about it)It's like running out of loveNo matter what you say, noAnd then it's too late to talk about it (too late to talk about it)Now let's talk about how it all goes downI used to make love to you dailyWhen the night fell, the sameAnd anytime that you were hurtI could feel your painAnd if I had a dollarIt was yours, yeah (ooh, yeah)And whenever we would go outI would front the bill
Baby, now I realizeAll of those times I told you I loved youI just didn't show it I'm sorryDon't put me outDon't put me outDon't put me outI remember when you said to meDon't talk about it be about itI should have felt you when you said to meThat you were all aloneI act like I was doing a favorFor you 'cuz you were with meSomething let me thinking that whatever happensThis would be my home but I was wrongHow could I have been so low?I wrote a song all about itWanna hear it, here we go, from now onI won't talk about lovin' you'Cuz I'm gonna be about lovin' youI won't talk about comin' home'Cuz I'm gonna be about comin' homeI won't talk about both of us'Cuz I'm gonna be about both of us
How did I ever let you slip awayNever knowing I'd be singing this song some dayAnd now I'm sinking,Sinking to rise no moreEver since youClosed the doorIf I could turn,Turn back the hands of timeThen my darlin' you'd still be mineIf I could turn,Turn back the hands of timeThen darlin' you, you'd still be mineFunny,Funny how time goes byAnd blessings are missedIn the wink of an eyeWhy oh why oh whyShould one have to go on sufferingWhen every day I prayPlease come back to meIf... I could turnTurn back the hands of timeThen my darling youYou would be mine
I'm sick and tired of the games you playedEvery move I make your ass got something to sayScandalize my name when you see it in the paperTrying to turn it all around when it wasn't that wayEverybody is trying to figure me outWhat the hell is wrong with y'all just let me live my lifeI can't go one day without y'all in my faceY'all done lost y'all minds if you don't hear what I sayCops chase me when I'm standing stillYou know I ain't done shit wrong so why you want me in your cellYou don't like my songs well it pays the billsAnd you cut me down cuz I keep it realSometimes I wanna fly far away from hereTo another place it ain't worth these tearsSometimes at night when I close my eyesI know the haters are busy making up hater liesSometimes I laugh trying to keep from cryingIf I was plain out of love then tell me who could I trust
Sky black and blueBlue turn to redThere's quiet in the streets nowBut it's screaming in your headI ain't a foolBut I've got my doubtsSay it doesn't hurtIt doesn't matter anyhow, anyhow...Saying, hey, you're just bleeding for nothingIt's hard to breathe when you're standing on your ownWe'll kill ourself to find freedomYou'll kill yourself to find anything at allSo lock all the doorsAnd put your child to restIt's quiet in the streets nowBut it's crying in your headWe're passing the time
Out of luck and out of tuneHalf a day and night confusedLove may wash away the bluesBut I still ain't over youDamn the day that I forgotCame so close and almost lostIt's been one year and fourteen monthsAnd I still ain't over youHey, I'm the blood in your veinsI'm the cold when it rainsI'm your heart when it breaks
Climb up a mountain, just to watch it come downBut sooner or later babe, you're gonna need me around'Cause you're getting older, ain't no stopping thatIt's a backstabbing world honey, just lean your head backThe fool in meIt's like a dream, you seeBut if the world is rightI'll drive all nightAnd meet you there somedaySix in the morning, never felt so sweetJust put on lucinda baby, and dance with me
The day is done, and now we're olderThe feeling's gone, so now you'll show herWhere love went wrong, on your shoulderYou're all alone, and you can't take it
Tonight the sunset means so muchThe one thing that you know you'll never touchLike the feeling, the real thingI reach out for that sweet dreamBut somehow the darkness wakes me upAnd I've felt this emptiness beforeBut all the times that I've been brokenI still run right back for moreYou'd think that I'd learn my lesson by nowYou'd think that I'd somehow figure outThat if you strike the matchYou're bound to feel the flameYou think that I'd learn the cost of lovePaid that price long enough

Love is a hunger that burns in my soulBut you never notice the painLove is an anchor that won't let me goI reach out to hold you but you push me awayAnd you always convince me to stayAnd I wonder why we hold on with tears in our eyesAnd I wonder why we have to break down to make things alrightAnd I wonder why I can't seem to tell you goodbyeYeah, I wonder whyI'm no angel with my selfish pride
How can you blame meFor the way I never felt beforeAnd all the mistakes that I made?It's just that I was so in loveI couldn't keep you close enoughI held too tight to the reinsIt can't keep a moment from passin' byLove's not a thing that you ownOh I, I guess it wasn't mineI didn't mean to lose the loveIt took so long to findI guess it wasn't mineI wore your heart upon my sleeve

Lie beside me on the grassThey're fighting for me theeMistress of beauty, thine eyes do shineCan we run forever? Does nightfall shine?Angel of mercy, carry me awayThose black dogs tear at meThey hunger for the life of me
The field of blood I'd leftThey mean nothing to youThat war left scars on meWithout you now, I'm freeI'd found out what you'd done to me, girlI hate with as much passion as I loveAnd so now, your time's come, for me girl
You, who stand there nowI will not tell you not to cryWithout fail my purposeWill be fulfilledI can crown you a GodAnd I'll suffer for your sinsBound so tightly, pain is everythingFar from kindness. I am your king
Your bloodied body is what I cling to.In powerful rain, they laid down their heads to die.Let your dark, thirsty eyes drink deep the sights of me.It's sad that, in our blindness, we gather thorns for flowers.Your river holds a feast of danger.The suffering you have had to bear.I'd die for that moment one more time.The loved one falls below your ideals.Pleasure too safely enjoyed lacks zest.
So vile men's torment was truly a pleasureA plain that would change mankind for ever moreCatherine Blake slept fitfully in theSummer night. In the heat.She murmured gently and moved smoothly,This way and that. Oh, the beauty.Her luscious eyes, delicate fingers,Clawed at her sodden bed.Catherine smiled. Took a fabulous breathOf summer air and tasted death.Die Erorians' visit had been successful rewarding.With night of female screams of whimpers,Lustful dreams.Night followed rampant night ofDelicate soft gasps.The ultimate attack on Heaven and it's glories.Seduce them as they slept, oblivious toTheir midnight tryst.
I cannot turn my life unto youWhat must I doA storm of ebony hair.A hail of wickedness.Handsome as a God.Wild and shameless.Given the prize of beauty.Image of wretchedness.Divine like no other.Kiss the poison breast.Flamed like the sun.Lives made undone.Words soft as snow.Souls claimed and won.An opiate drugged haze.Beds of shapeless dust.
Under the darkened, ancient oakGentle in the night's breezeI stop and stare, rest a whileWith hands upon my kneesThrough jaded leaves, bush and scrubI spy my journey's endBlack it looms, silent gloomThe castle called AvendOn I trot, past forest eyesPast horrors of the nightThrough the dark, I see a signA gentle glowing lightUpon reaching the castle I ascend the ivyTowards the golden windowMy heart pounds, my breath is rushedAs I fight both brick and branchThe ledge is mine and over I sweepSilent like the falling snowQuiet, I slip across the polished floor
Come from where you hide.(So I may) unchain my tempest.None will stop my tide.(And you will) tremble at my unrest.Find you I will(And take you) up into your Heaven.Commeth soon the kill.
Your unbreathing sleep.Our dreamless bed,Is mine to keep.In my dark eyes and frozen arms,Nothing lives 'cept my harm.Now you're worn with years.Years and sorrows.
The weary creak of my bonesExhausted voice, deathly tonesArms of lead, skin drawn tightNo long a princely sightFace is gaunt, pale and thinBent and grey and full of sinPass to meWine and songFor I'll beSoon long goneCast me down, upon the dustMy dry bones remain tomblessFrom my life, a rose is grown
A Serpent it came to meRight before my eyesI looked to God way above meHe looked down at my liesI said "oh Lord please help meI am on my knees""Your path is yours" he told me"Yours to reap"
In fiery flight we would leaveThis hallThe Holy house, House ofGod will fallTo death they go with musicAnd songBut our dread simply mustGo onI feel our need to feed goes onFor our greed, watch themBleeding onThis hour's ours, with openArms go on
Your name will walk the yearsOf shameYour hands, my face, the look,The tasteTo gaze how fondly on thyBeautiful faceTo fold thee in my great arms,
An unfortunate journeyThrough a bleak sea ofLonelinessI carved through the wavesOf griefIn a black vastness of selfDoubtI have never felt so aloneSo pitiful and wretchedAnd lowI'm tried by a terrible windThe misery and the painsBlowFill my vast sails of ruinSteer me toward a bleak endA horizon of purples andRedsThe still waters of myWelcome endThe clouds of grey comeOverheadA storm will hunt me downAnd rip the guts out of myBodyThat I would surely drownThe unforgiving wind
Adorn magnificent costumeFor I come to judge the worldBe with me here in my dark placeLet yours be mineCut me and I do not bleedHeat is my bodyThe poor and simple foolsEqual under my presenceLift up your headBlessed in the womb that bare thee
Burdens of grief that weigh against meAid my tired eyes in their search for pitchYour kinds heart now pinesFor whom the gods love dies youngWrapped and confounded in a thousand fearsThe sadness I present, smiles with tearsWhere once I'd loved now lied forlorn beautyAnd wars abhorred by mothersNo man lives so poor as he was bornWe don't remember pure sensationsGaze peacefully into the pastI am dust, and to dust I shall returnBelial, Mephisto, both shall burn me upDevour my sad whimperingsThe cutting whip is mine to feel
(The Silence)Oh beautiful earthFor too long you have been silentTouch me once againThe dark ground lies coldEt gelidus hoc voluntas firma-MentumHarkYes it is IThe fever of mankindUrges whorish as everI am the new ChristSilence yourselfNunquamYou are powerless herePityful onePity me notGive back the sunSouls will mournIn this unending season of darknessBeware, ravaged oneMine is the mightIf you're feeble, turn awayNo dagger glints in my handTechnique is secretLiarShe have herself to me(The Sadness)
A cruel sleep 'cross our landAll withered and dyingAs the fall, the victimsThey're dying a sad deathIn our land, we lay downAnd suffer againA dark girl'cross our landIs pacing. Is preyingAnd with her, a feverA marching black feverNo eyes see. No featuresJust black form, sufferingYou have her sympathyYou have her tears
All are welcome hereTo the Eden FeastEnter if you willThis is EdenbeastFaces stay hiddenBehind their dark masksIn arms they enterThe Great Hall of SinEden, calls againFor sick minds. For meInside there. All laid bareTake your pick. Devour nowLust clawing at your feet
An isle, a bright shining isleStands forever, alone in the seaOf rock and of sand and grassAnd shale, the isle bereft of trees.- Small. A speck in the wide blueSea. 'Tis the last of all the land.A dweller upon our lonesomeIsle, the last, lonely man? -By the Gods he is there toNever leave, to remain all hisLife. His punishment forEvermore, to attend theEternal light.The lighthouse, tall and brilliantWhite, which stands at the endOf the world. Protecting shipsAnd sailors too, from rock theyCould be hurledYet nothing comes and nothingGoes 'sept the bright blue sea.Which stretches near and farAway, 't is all our man can see.Though, one day, up high onRock, a bird did perch and cry.An albatross, he shot a glance,And wondered deeply, why?Could it be a watcher sent?A curse sent from the Gods,Who sits and cries and stares at him,The life that they have robbed.Each year it comes to watchOver him, the creature from above.Not a curse but a reminder ofThe woman that he loved.- Oh weary night, under stars,He'd lay and gaze.Up towards the moon and stars.The suns dying haze.Time and again, Orion's lightFilled our man with joy.Within the belt, he'd see his love,Remembering her voice -The twinkle from the stars aboveBled peace into his heartAs long as she looks down on himHe knows they'll never partOne day good, one day badThe madness, the heat, the sun,Out to sea, he spies upon land.His beloved Albion.
Enter the Ghost Lake.The waters whisperOf something brooding.No way out of here.Slow smouldering,Slow raining heat.Lapping at your skinPulling you down again.I wish that I couldFan back to lifeThe dying embersOf my long lost passion.Descending deeper.With black as my light.With twist and turn.All men will be tried in life.We look for light to call.The call to save us all.Lest we fall to our knees.The death, we kiss his feet.Oh, sacred mother come.For our fate is done.In blindness do we runAlways backwards.
Time wears out affections.I hope to be missed.Your presence on my wing.Arise from my sickness.My hopes, eclipsed by failures.Dismal moments fall on me.A terrible sobbingEchoed through my own house.The lightening gets frightening.Oh, cover me.Memories of her sadden me.
Mother will you take me down?I have become so afraidMother please, please take me downI am sorry, your boy is not braveChild just hold on. Night will soon be goneSleep if you can. But watch your father's handWe do not want you. No-body loves you
The chosen one glows like the sunPure of heart, wide in eyeSweet she sings, sings her hymnsGolden girl dances byHe is filth. Scum of GodBlack as night. Mute and sickSent by the Lord. The boy his swordTo reap the gold. To use the stick
You're mine when you're bleedingDivine to the endBid adieu to your breathingNo more pretenceI will witness your leavingWith tears in my eyesBut not for your sleepingJust when you ariseThe girl you take in youWill now cease to be

I'll catch you if you fallMy arms run deep. Run unto my callI'll lead you into dangerAnd all that troubles manI'll lead you far from hungerJust take my frozen handYou'll want the world to praise youAnd gather at your feetYou'll want my blinding light

You know it kills me to see such a pretty girl so tiredYou've got your mother's cheekbones and your father's crooked smileForget all those places that you've never really beenAnd all those situations you somehow found yourself inLet your body sink into meLike your favorite memoryLike a line of poetryOr a fucking fit of honestyI'll do my best to keep you, keep you sleepy as the southWith my old watch on your wristAnd my thumbs inside your mouthSuck on my fingertips until you kill all my printsSo your boyfriend has no clueOf how much I've been touching youMy problem with me is my problem with youIt doesn't take muchFor me to come unglued
I'm sick of seeing you cryAnd wasting all your timeOn someone who will never care enoughTo make you feel lovedTo make you feel safeI would drop my life to take his placeTo show you just how goodBeing touched could beCommit these words to memoryFor when you find yourself
I used to think that I knewMy way around this townBut I'm always getting lostSince you're not aroundI never thought that I would say thisBut I miss my momEven though for all those yearsWe didn't get alongAnd when I stop to think about itI guess we were the sameToo stubborn to apologizeToo filled upon rageI wish she felt young again
I used to know this girlWho gave her love awayTo every guy she metAnd with all the games they playedShe never seemed to cryShe never got upsetAnd one by one they cameAnd one by one they leftI thought that I could fix herIf she would let me inBut all of my advancesWere shut down in the endWhen days turned into monthsI begged her to explainAnd this is what she sangIt's not like I'm a slut
I'm not a victim of some feeble mind diseaseAlthough some of my old friends would tend to disagreeI know these chemicals will get the best of meI'm not saying that I want to quit it just makes it hard to breathBut who needs lungs when you just bought a brand new penAnd there's stacks and stacks of envelopes just waiting to be sentI looked through my closet and I found those magazinesI circled all the writers that I one day hoped to meetDon't get me wrong I don't mind getting bad reviews
I'm up and down againI'm losing all my friendsBut it's all rightI'm forcing her to leaveAnd she's the better half of meBut it's all rightI miss the both of youSo much that I can't moveBut it's all rightIf you give me a little timeTo straighten out my mindThings will be all right, all rightI want to thank you for our talk
Here is the pointWhere I fall apartFor the second time in a weekIt could be fromAll those chemicalsThat I pump into meYou have been goneFor what feels likeThe longest winter breakIt's just three daysBut it's so much moreThan I can really takeI've got a girl problemI've got a drug problem
From South CarolinaTo San FranciscoI'm always waiting hereOutside of this doorI hope that my key fitsI hope that this lock clicksBecause I'll find you standing thereWith your dyed black hairWe'll put that old record onAnd dance to your favorite song
Yeah...Its getting dark outsideThe wind blows through the treesReminds me of the timeYou said we'd always beAnd I'm left here with all this confusionAnd I wish that we could go backCHORUSTo the days when you and IWere you and meThe stars shone brightly aboveAnd I wish that you and ICould be you and meSome one to share this loveSome one to share this love with
Feeling like this could only meanI'm sinking.Feeling like this could only meanI'm sinking.Well, I'm sinking.Pull me out.Every time I see your clothes scattered out on the floorI say I thought you would be home.You said you never would be gone.Every time I see the light not burning on the porchI say I thought you would be home.You said you never would be goneBut you are.
All the things we never know we needLooks like we get them in the endMeasure time in leisure time and greedAnd by the time we get to spendA floating bedA head of stoneA home plugged into every phoneKimono coral floral printExclusive tint and cut reclusiveNo it doesn't come for freeBut it's the price we pay for happinessNo don't talk about more to life than thisDream a world maybe no one ownsNo don't think about all the life we missSwallow doubt as the hunger grows
Your hands on my hips pull me right back to youI catch that thrust, give it right back to youYou're in so deep, I'm breathing for youYou grab my braids, arch my back high for youYou're diesel engine, I'm squirting mad oilDown on the floor 'til my speaker starts to boilI flip s***, quick slip, hip dip and I'm twistedIn your hands and your lips and your tongue tricksAnd you're so thick and you're so thick and you're so
Here in this townSafe and guardedWe call it homeA feeling that we share, nowI leave this placeClinging to hopeAnd this midnight prayerIf we hold our breathFloat beyond this, we'll be rebornI will carry us homeAre you still alive?Are you scared inside?Providence is blind when you're terrifiedAre you still alive?Are you scared inside?When we've reached the end of the roadI will carry us home
Come, smash up your seats tonightSippin'on wineI'm fineThe music keeps me up all nightCause I'm full of lustCome with usRun for your livesI'm only lonely when the music's overLonely when you're going homeWe don't celebrate Sundays anymore(We don't celebrate Sundays)My good church is not open on Sundays(We don't celebrate Sundays)
I sleep with windows openI sleep with eyes wideIn case you would come walkingIn case you change your mindBut don't strain yourself for meDon't break yourself for meDon't lose your selfish ways for meI keep a leash around youAnd I keep it nice and tight
Let it fallLet It fallLet it fallLet It fallSo I weepSo I weepSo I weepSo I weepIn my weakest moments I weep'Cause I like the way tears fit my cheekIn my darkest moments I cryOh how I love the way tear suits my faceI like it saltI like it wetLike my makeup in a messSo I cry hardLet it fallAnd I won't stop until my tears are all shedSo I weepSo I weepSo I weepSo I weepSo I weepSo I weepAnd I won't stop until my tears are all shed
Freak out and give inDoesn't matter what you believe inStay cool and be somebody's fool this year'Cause they know who is righteous, what is boldSo I'm toldWho wants honeyAs long as there's some moneyWho wants that honey?Hipsters unite, come align for the big fight to rock for youBut beware, all those angels with their wings glued on
Today is the greatestDay I've ever knownCan't live for tomorrowTomorrow's much too longI'll tear my eyes outBefore I get outI wanted moreThan life could ever grant meBored by the choreOf saving faceToday is the greatestDay I've ever known
Faith lies inThe ways of sinI chased the charmedBut I don't want them anymoreAnd in their eyes, I was aliveA fool's disguiseTake me away from youShame my tongueFat with promise all alongWhen I woke up from that sleepI was happier than I'd ever been
Nothing left to sayAnd all I've left to doIs run away from youShe led me on, downWith secrets I can't keepClose your eyes and sleepDon't wait up for meHush now, don't you speakTo meWrapped my hurt in youAnd took my shelter in that painThe opiate of blame
Feel itBreak your bonesMr. JonesTaste meAs I bleedTaste my needAnd spaceboy, I've missed youSpinning round my headAnd any way you choose meYou'll break insteadWatch me
Day after dayTime passed awayAnd I just can't get you off my mindNobody knows, I hide it insideI keep on searching but I can't findThe courage to show to letting you knowI've never felt so much love beforeAnd once again I'm thinking aboutTaking the easy way outBut if I let you go I will never knowWhat my life would be holding you close to meWill I ever see you smiling back at me? (oh, yeah!)
Everybody's looking for that somethingOne thing that makes it all completeYou find it in the strangest placesPlaces you never knew it could beSome find it in the face of their childrenSome find it in their lover's eyesWho can deny the joy it bringsWhen you've found that special thingYou're flying without wingsSome find it sharing every morningSome in their solitary livesYou'll find it in the words of others
An empty street, an empty houseA hole inside my heartI'm all alone, the rooms are getting smallerI wonder how, I wonder whyI wonder where they areThe days we had, the songs we sang togetherOh, yeahAnd oh, my loveI'm holding on foreverReaching for the love that seems so farSo, I say a little prayerAnd hope my dreams will take me thereWhere the skies are blueTo see you once again, my loveOverseas from coast to coastTo find a place I love the mostWhere the fields are greenTo see you once againMy loveI try to read, I go to work

Shadows fill an empty heartAs love is fadingFrom all the things that we areBut are not sayingCan we see beyond the scarsAnd make it to the dawn?Change the colours of the skyAnd open up toThe ways you made me feel aliveThe ways I loved youFor all the things that never diedTo make it through the nightLove will find youWhat about now?What about today?What if you're making meAll that I was meant to be?What if our love never went away?What if it's lost behindWords we could never find?Baby, before it's too lateWhat about now?

This part's for my love of oldHow the rose in your heart you holdStill all the water in your wells won't make it growOh, the call of the nightingaleHow I love beneath the ghostly sailsWe move like gypsies 'neath the mist and beneath the gloomOh, how the river flowsUnder the ice and snowThe keeper of the flame
Awake without warningThe black of the morningAll shimmery jewelsFrom the voice of a foolEchoes through the hallsOf the buildingHe built in her placeHe'll shake through the winterAnd dream of her misterThe picture he drew herResembled her sisterOh how the windCan pull you inOr push you awayYou'll move like a tigerInto the thicketClaws in the dirtYou'll sing like a cricketSong of the mysterySong of the systemSong for the guiltySong for the living
I know you've got to goAnd I wanted to be afraid to sayBut I'm notI'm scared to death of what you've becomeYou were my only allyNow you're looking around for an alibiWhy don't you go ask your new set on the set of lies?You cheated me and I can't believe itI've been calling since four o'clock last nightYou cheated me and I can't believe itI saw you singing and dancing in the rainAll the way home
Far away, in some lovely way I hear your callWhatever happened to them all?Whatever happened to us all?I know that we've never met beforeBut that was then and now I need you moreIs someone here keeping the score?Is there only dying at your door?Taking me down off this cross
Here I am, where I've beenI've walked a hundred miles in tobacco skin,And my clothes are worn & gritty.And I know ugliness,Now show me something pretty.I was a dumb punk kid with nothing to loseAnd too much weight for walking shoes.I could have died from being boring.As for loneliness,She greets me every morning.At the most I'm a glare,
I know you've been here beforeThere's a pain that you hold like a heart that's gone coldLiving your life alone, no matter what your friends sayIt don't have to be that wayLet me love the hurt awayI know just what to do, I can satisfy youYou can open up to meI'll show you what love can do, baby(Yeah oh)Put your hand in mineTrust me, girl, you'll never findI'll be all the man that you needI'll take you to the highest heightPlay with you and hold you tightI'll be all the man that you needI'll kiss you here, there, everywhereRun my fingers through your hairCan't you feel the man in me?I'm talking not just for one night, girlI want to spend my lifeBeing all the man that you need
(I can't stop loving you)I've made up my mindTo live in memories of the lonesome times(I can't stop wanting you)It's useless to saySo I'll just live my life in dreams of yesterday (dreams of yesterday)Those happy hours that we once knewTho' long ago, they still make me blueThey say that time heals a broken heartBut time has stood still since we've been apart
Why does the color of my coffee match your eyes?Why do I see you when a stranger passes by?I swear, I hear you in the whisper of the windI feel you when the sun is dancin' on my skinAnd when it's rainin'You won't find me complainin' 'causeWhen I think about rainI think about singin'When I think about singin'It's a heavenly tuneWhen I think about Heaven thenI think about agelsWhen I think about angelsI think about youThe taste of sugar sure reminds me of your kissI like the way that they both linger on my lipsKisses remind me of a field of butterfliesMust be the way the heart is fluttering inside
He promised her a new and better lifeOut in ArizonaUnderneath the blue neverending skySwore that he was gonnaGet things in orderHe'd send for herWhen he left her behindIt never crossed her mindThere is no ArizonaNo Painted Desert, no SedonaIf there was a Grand CanyonShe could fill it up with the lies he's told herBut they don't exist, those dreams he sold herShe'll wake up and find there is no Arizona
I've got sunshine, on a cloudy dayWhen it's cold outside, I've got the month of MayI guess you'd say, "What can make me feel this way?"My girl (my girl) my girl, talkin' 'bout my girlI've go so much honey, the bees envy meI've got a sweeter song, baby, than the birds in the treesI guess you'd say, "What can make me feel this way?"
It's tricky when you feel someone has done something on your behalfIt's slippery when your sense of justice murmurs underneath and is asking you,How am I going to make it right?How am I going to make it right?With a palm full of stars
The happiest day I ever knewIn a sea of gold down next to youSo blurred and tired under summer sunYou whispered dreams of a world to come...We were so in loveIn this sea of gold so young and tiredUnder summer sun hard by your sideWhispering dreams down next to you...We were so in loveThe happiest dayYeah the happiest day I knewBut summer sun sea of goldThis perfect day so long ago
All my lifeIs changing every dayEvery possible way.And all my dreams,Is never quite as it seems,Is never quite as it seems,I know I've felt like this before,But now I'm feeling it even more,Because it came from you,I know I've felt like this before,But now I'm feeling it even more,
Black night is fallingThe sun is gone to bedThe innocent are dreamingAs you should, sleepy-headSleepy-head, sleepy-head:All the love aboveI send into youComfort and protectionI'll watch over youBut don't ask meWhat's gonna happen nextI know the futureI'd love to lead you the way
Why do I love it so much?What kind of magic is this?How come I can't help adore it?It's just another musicalNo one minds it at allIf I'm having a ballThis is a musicalAnd there's always someoneTo catch meThere's always someone to catch meThere's always someone to catch meThere's always someone to catch meWhen you fall
I've been watching me fall for it seems like yearsWatching me grow smallI watch me disappearSlipping out my ordinary worldOut my ordinary eyesYeah slipping out the ordinary meInto someone else's lifeInto someone else's life...There's a thin white cold new moonAnd the snow's coming downAnd the neon bright Tokyo lightsFlicker through the crowdI've been drifting around for hoursAnd I'm lost and I'm tiredWhen a whisper in my earInsatiable breezeWhy don't you follow me inside?Yeah the room is smallThe room is brightHer hair is blackThe bed is whiteAnd the night is always youngIs always young
Side by side in silenceThey pass away the daySo comfortable, so habitual...And so nothing left to sayNothing left to sayNothing left to saySide by side in silenceHis thoughts echo round
I had visions, I was in themI was looking into the mirrorTo see a little bit clearerThe rottenness and evil in meFingertips have memoriesMine can't forget the curves of your bodyAnd when I feel a bit naughtyI run it up the flagpole and see who salutesBut no one ever doesI'm not sick but I'm not wellAnd I'm so hot, cause I'm in hellBeen around the world and foundThat only stupid people are breedingThe cretins cloning and feeding
I don't feel alrightIn spite of these comforting sounds you makeI don't feel alrightBecause you make promises that you breakInto your houseWhy don't we shareOur solitude?Nothing is pureAnymore
It's an elusive thingThis love of which you singWhat are we doingWhat are we doing?I will give you anythingJust please don't stop singingThe world will stop spinning roundYou're such a lovely thingBut there is ice formingUpon your pretty wingsWhat are you protecting?I'll give you everything
I don't wanna be here, I don't wanna be here at allStuck in my head, trapped inside these wallsSo much regret, so much painI'm drowning slowly in the mess that I've madeI don't wanna be here, I don't wanna be here at allCan I let it go or I will it haunt my soul?How did I get this way? God, I feel so afraidWill I'll be a better man, when I'll learn to understand?I can't keep on living unforgiven
Like a star, slipping out of placeSliding from the sky, tumbling through spaceWhen you touch my hand,I swear I feel... like I'm falling(Falling, falling, falling)Seems like I'm falling...(Falling, falling, falling)Like a wheel whirling, round and round,Rolling down a hill (rolling-down-a-hill),Spining on the groundYour kisses make my dizzy (yeah)In the head... and I'm falling,(Falling, falling, falling)Falling...Uh-oh girl,I think that I have fell for you

I am grey, still on the pageOh colour me inJust an outline, sketchy but fineOh colour me inIf green is chasing the hills over milesIf blue is pursuing the skyIf the red of your heart doesn't mindWhere to begin to colour me in

Inside the mask another disguiseI fall to sleep before closing my eyesTiredness draws, in my head a cartoonSun at the window, good things coming soonShake your earrings over my head
The sky is faint, their tears remainIn me the rain has stopped fallingThe fading light, walls barely whiteIn me the night has stopped callingI will not lament with the skyNo longer feel night on the insideHere in this room, no more a tomb
I wait on the stairs for a break in my mindLet the balloons go outsideLet the balloons go outsideI wait on the stairs for my thoughts to alignYou are the sun in my mindYou are the sun in my mindClouds rock like a ship at seaSooth the waves of injuryClouds rock like a ship at seaSooth the waves of injury
How many words did you come up with today?How many words do you want to hear tonight?You flare up but beneath lies defeat.I see your eyes now and they are calm.I've answered enough phones for one life.I've worn too many ties around my neck.I wake up and I find a trace of you there.So sullen, your words haunt the airI wake up and I find a trace of you there.

I've met so many people who look the sameMost were forgotten but you still remainMost of the time, I don't careBut London's so far away when you are there.And so it saddens me to sayI'm only happy when I move awayI am young and I am lostEvery sentence has its costI am young and I am lostYou react to my riposteAnd we look out upon the seaWe look out upon the seaThe coast is always changingI'll bring my camera out to seaThe coast is always changingAge makes no difference 'til you open your mouth

I guess I met her at the party pitShe said those kids she's with were selling itSo we sailed off on some separate tripsShe got pinned down at the party pitI went away to school that fallShe stuck around with all those stickpin dollsSped through the scene until the engine stalledAt some suburban shopping mallSailed away on such separate tripsAnd she got pinned down at the party pitSailed away on such separate tripsAnd she got pinned down at the party pitI came back to start a band, of courseSaw her walking through the crystal courtShe made a scene by the revolving doorsShe's gonna walk around and drink some more
The guys were feeling good about their liqour run.The girls were kinda flirting with the setting sun.We all kinda fumbled thru the jitterbug.We were all powered up on some new upper drug.Everyone was funny and everyone was pretty.Everyone was coming towards the center of the city.The dancefloor was crowded. the bathrooms were worse.We kissed in your car and we drank from your purse.I had my mouth on her noseWhen the chaperone said that we were dancing too close.We had some massive nights.Every song was right.All that wine was tight.
The useless drag of another day;The endless drags of a death rock boy.Mascara sure and lipstick lost,Glitter burned by restless thoughts, of being forgotten.And in your sad machines, you'll forever stay,Desperate and displeased with whoever you are,And you're a star.
The world is a vampireSent to drainSecret destroyersHold you up to the flamesAnd what do I getFor my pain?Betrayed desiresAnd a piece of the gameEven though I knowI suppose I'll showAll my cool and coldLike old JobDespite all my rage I am still just a rat in a cageDespite all my rage I am still just a rat in a cageThen someone will say, "What is lost can never be saved"Despite all my rage I am still just a rat in a cageNow I'm naked

Half life wastes before it goesIt's funny how your bee sting touch never leaves me wholeIt's not enough to stay here almost tryingYou keep your last laugh watch this dyingIt's just your half time vertigoAnd if you want an answer, I don't knowChorusIf you had completed me
It takes too much to please meAttached but no real feelingHigh fives and corporate anthemsNothing comes to mindKitemarked for true low standardsWhere more wants all and no lessJust change with no real progressNothing comes to mind
I know you know my heads not in this nowNothing you could keep so keep me downLike the stones beneath the water that you walk on to be tallerThe hands you stuck together cause you prayed you'd wait foreverJust another fragile angel heartFalling down on lead wings torn apartAnd the words beneath my skinThe ink that you put in
We're always too always in doubtWorks on meShe's nowhere she mainlines helps me outNow i can speakWas heard not seen wasted nothings freeWas black was bruised fucked up twenty twoI'm amazed you eat you sleep you function at all'Cos my aims so weak i'd fail to get into my armWas made the first to laugh
Different ways of countingFingers running through your hairTen to twenty lifelinesIf you doubt how this comparesThere's fear enough to shareA fear of loathingSo easy how you bearThe trace of me without you thereSo fall like the snowToo much too slowToo fragile to sayHanging over every dayA breeze with contemptTo shame the others
I see you couldn't catch your breathBelieve me it's all that it must beYou see i never said my pieceIf only you left it that easyFractured we have been since sometime sixteenFailure was on me cause your ideals bore meDoes it take the fireworks to make you look in wonder?Would you give reaction to the cause i'm under?

Skinheads, all you skinheadsC'mon let's move and groove:You all hipocrite, you all hippopotamus, you all hipocrite, you...

Bacharach-DavidNow and thenI see you passing byAnd for a whileI don't begin to cryBut just when I think I'm all cried outAnother tear falls
Just in case they're wonderingThey've got us pinned terriblyThey don't believe our love is realCause they don't know how real love feelsYou should know it's trueJust now, the part about my love for youAnd how my heart's about to burstInto a thousand piecesOh it must be trueAnd They'll believe us too, soonBaby, it's factThat our love is trueThe way black is blackAnd blue is just blueMy love is trueIt's a matter of factOh, and you love me tooIt's a simple as thatBaby, our love is trueThey may say some awful thingsBut there's no point in listeningYour words are the only wordsThat I believe in afterwards.You should know it's trueJust now, the part about my love for youAnd how my heart's about to burstInto a thousand pieces
If you're looking to tell itAll and save your soul, I know what you can doYou can start by letting me inSo we could begin to mend these salted woundsYou sacrifice, you sacrifice and if we bleed it's justifiedAnd I can't look into your face, it's been harder than you've knownAnd I can't find a single place that these demons haven't shownSo go to sleep, I need to be aloneDon't ya, don't ya wanna tell someoneWhat you have done and get it off your chest?
Sit and watch you from my window,Giving yourself away.You've been working hard all day.I see the ground catch at your feet,I see the sweet signs of defeat,Like you're beaten but you feel no pain.And then you turn to me instinctively,Checking if you're alone,Like a reflex from my guilty mind.I fall away into the background,Like a shadow on the wall,To leave you with your peace of mind.I watch from, my window up high,All alone in this room.So many people go the same way,I think it's time that I changed my view.Like a king in his lonely kingdom,A ruler who had no rules.Ooh, I got nothing got left to lose,An' I think it's time that I changed my view.
Let your love flow downLet it fall to the groundTherein lies the rootsReaching for the streetAll I wanna do... Is Keep on reaching throughKeep on reaching through.To the river wide and strongIt won't take longWe could all go together
I see an old man on the street,Without shoes and nothing to eat.I ask myself, can this happen to me,Whose's the one, who cares about these threat?What a fuck is going on?Ignorance and "take it gone"!Sorrow is a normal thing,Silence about suffering.
Breathing in your sip of goldI follow all your little linesI like to watch a thousand timesI want to feel you hereI like to watch a thousands timesI make a shrine for you
They fall from your mouthPropelled by your belly and your tongueI shiver when you shake and I fold into jellyI think I loved you more than meAre you human, or a dud?Are you human, or d'you make it up?My baby cherry slippedPass me through your fingertips
It's a strange dayNo colours or shapesNo sound in my headI forget who I amWhen I'm with youThere's no reasonThere's no senseI'm not supposed to feel
Night has fallenMute and coldMy horse is cryingBut you know all this timeBut you know all this timeThat you'd never wantKeep you stillDare to comeBut you love me stillBut you love me

My name is Judge Roughneck,And I will not tolerate any disobedience in my courtroom.Rude boy, you have been brought inFront of me and chargedWith smashing this woman's window.Before I sentence you,What have you got to say in your defense?I was walking down the street one nightWhen I saw her silhouette in her bathroom lightHer way of life may be nothing to hideWith her frosted glass shattered, curtains open wideNaked woman, naked man,Where did you get that nice sun tan?You live in a castle built of sandNaked woman, naked man...
Well, it's hard to tell whose dream we're inBut the sky fell while we were talkingAmid the bruises and the red lightsWill you call me your darling tonight?Call, call me your darling tonightIt's a dark wind that's been blowingIt's a steel river rollingWhen the dawn cracks I will be alrightIf you call me your darling tonightCall, call me your darling tonight
Just like anythingTo singTo singTo singIs a state of mindSunlight dances slowly on a drum beats broken rhymeI speak in answers only to see them in my mindIf I had a penny I'd throw it in the seaTo see if would float awayOr grow of any tree
This is the time that we all should live as one, brothersThis is the time that we all should live as one, sistersSo come along brothers and come along sistersU.N.I.T.Y., this unitySo come along brothers and sisters, woahAah aah, we must live as one
A misty shadow spread it's wingsAnd covered all the groundAnd even though the sun was outThe rain came pouring downAnd all the light had disappearedAnd faded in the gloomThere was no hope, no reasoningThis rainy day in juneThe eagle spread it's mighty wingsAnd pounced upon it's prayAnd all the skies, so brilliant blue
Well, the drums rolled off in my foreheadAnd the guns went off in my chestRemember carrying the baby just for youCrying in the wildernessI lost track of my friends, I lost my kinI cut them off as limbsI drove out over the flatlandHunting down you and himThe sky was big and emptyMy chest filled to explodeI yelled my insides out at the sunAt the wide open roadIt's a wide open roadIt's a wide open roadSo, how do you think it feels
I couldn't sleep last nightI walked aloneOn the beachWhere we always used to goWhen we couldn't up at homeI thought of youAnd the time we jumped the fencePool-side, stripped downWe dove right inAnd the cops chased us againWhen you were mineYou know...We had it all in front of usYou were the oneI was in loveBut you always hurtThe one you lostI couldn't get enoughYou were everythingThat's bad for meMake no apologiesI'm crushed...Black and blue
Do I have nothing good left to say?Do I need whiskey to start fueling my complaints?People love to drink their troubles away.Sometimes I feel that I'd be better off that way.'Cause maybe then I could sleep at night.I wouldn't lay awake until the morning light.This is something that I'll never control.My nerves will be the death of me, I know.I know, I know.
You sheltered me from harmKept me warm, kept me warmYou gave my life to meSet me free, set me freeThe finest years I ever knewWere all the years I had with youAnd I would give anything I ownGive up my life, my heart, my homeI would give everything I ownJust to have you back again
What happened to me?I'm just a girlOnly a girl wanting to be someoneAnd if I try... ohAnd if I dream... oh.And if I seeMy heart inside of me.Let's go flying together.Let's go fly like a bird... ye... ye... ye...Let's go skating the skyTo hear my voice an your cry.I just want to be free in this worldI hope that everybody understandsI just want to be free and fly awayAnd smell all the flowers in my heartI want to feel the love in me
In the faceOf changeThat's when she turned to me and said"I'm not sure anymore"And thereAmidst the waves and the cloudless skiesThat blanket the year beforeI watch my life wash ashoreHave you ever been a part of somethingThat you thought would never end?And then, of course it didHave you ever felt the weight inside youPulling away inside your skin?And then something had to giveNow the lines are drawnIs this feeling gone?The best parts of this have come and goneAnd now that is all this isAnd with the reasons clear
I only see myself reflected in your eyesSo all that I believe I am essentially are liesAnd everything I've hoped to be or ever thought I wasDied with your belief in me so who the hell am I?I don't know if I am real without youWhat is left of me without you?I don't know what's real without youHow can I exist without you?I'm wand'ring 'round confused, wondering why I try
I'm feeling the weight of the worldAnd it's crushing meI'm feeling the weight of everyday lifeAnd it's crushing meHow much moreWill it takeHow much moreUntil it breaks meThis worldIs crushing meI'm feeling the weight of the worldAnd it's crushing meI'm feeling the weight of everyday lifeAnd it's crushing meHow much more
Six o'clock in the morningMy head is ready to explodeI can't believe I made it home aliveI don't remember where I went orWhat I was drinkingI know it made me sickAnd I'm not denyingThat I get this wayWhen I try to get over youI get this wayWhen I try to get over youSometimes it hurts so muchTo lose the one you loveSometimes it hurts so muchTo lose the one you love
Johnny's got a light on his eyes andShirley's got a light on her lipsJake's got a monkeyshine on his head andDebra Ann's got a tiger in her hipsThey can twist and turn they can move and burnThey can throw themselves against the wallBut they creep for what they needAnd they explode to the call and then they moveMove(Sex beat)Sex beat, goStupid like I told ya,Stupid like ya sawStupid as the simple thoughtOf ever thinking at allAnd all the mind, all the soul

Two smiling faces, that's how it used to beWhat once was forever, now a faded memoryThe perfect illusion, for a while I guess it wasWithout explanation the bloom fell off the roseHeaven help my heart, 'cause it's a lot like meWondering when this all will end and I find the love I needI know it's out there somewhere,Somehow I still believeI'm asking pleaseHeaven help my heartThis world can get crazy, these are troubled timesI'd walk through fire if love is what I'd find
I will wait until the endWhen the pendulum will swing back to theDarker side of our hearts bleedingI will save this empty spaceNext to me like it's a graveWhere I lay a place for us to sleep eternally togetherI have been searching for traces of what we wereA ghost of you is all that I have leftIt's all that I have left of you to holdI wake in the night to find there's no one there but meAnd nothing left of what we were at all
Bleeding wounds never clot even after deathMurdered dead look on from beyond, never to returnNo way back at all, trappedBetween life and death, Wlwe can't return to fleshI'm dead now, life has passed in the grave
BleedingSlicing through the fleshA knife stuck in your neckStabbing out your eyesCutting through the spineBlood burning through my veinsWe have risen from the graveLive, lifeDead for years, now aliveThe dead came to lifeDead for years, now aliveThe dead came to lifeDead creatures out for blood
There's movement in the nightShades are dancing in a pale moonlightNocturnal occurrenciesImagination no the night is realI'm looking for the truthBut never can I find a traceOf bloody witches ritualsIn the night I hear them howlA sound so low it must be realOr is it my fantasyAs sunlight fades into a twilightThe moon contrasts against a darkening skyTemperature of the air is going down

As the blood begins to gush out the side of your neckI thrust my cold steel into your face, your closer to deathA twelwe inch blade will help decide your ultimate fateThis summons to die has been given to you for accepting my hateStabbed in the throatFor no reason but to kill, for no reason but the thrillYou must die for me to surviveStabbed in the throatI believe in sacrifice, sliced open with my knifeYour body is now life deprivedVocal cords twitching, esophagus severed, a hemorrhaging brainYour lacerated jugular vein is spurting awayAs mortality fades I am ready to flay your whole body and headVigorously carving this fresh human flesh, I am one with the dead

Swollen with liquid, ready to burstA load of my lymph will quench this dead body's thirstOne month in the grave, twisted and half decayedShe turned a putrid yellow, I pissed in her maggot filled assholeFucking the rotting, my semen is bleedingThe smell of decay seeps from her genital cavityThe smell was unbearable as I unburied herI cum blood from my erection
No escape from your fateDestined to be mineEvery night I wait to seeIn the dark, watchingStalking your every moveI know when you're all aloneAll aloneTied tight to the bedLegs spread open
I cannot scream, my mouth is wired shutI cannot see, my eyes are filled with bloodI must die while sufferingPawn of torturous punishmentLosing all reason to liveCherishing this painful deathTo become part of theDead human collectionDead human collectionI cannot hear with punctured ear drums
Lusting for eternal painBegging to be torturedAgony brings relief, I am insaneIndulging in self-mutilationTo satisfy my need againThe pain severe from severed veinsCuring me of deprivationPain I craveEuphoric state of butcheryRevelling in gore and bloodPain I saveIgniting visions of the pastDismembered bodies never foundPain i gave
I'm going back, thinking about all the changes.I'm going back to all those wasted years.I see the rise and fall of the world I lived in.This time it doesn't seem real at all.But I took the fall and on came all the changes.All i had could not be saved - it was far too late.Everyone leaves. In the end.Everything dies. In the end.It doesn't matter how hard you hold on.
It's been ten long years since I smelled the witch.I don't think she will ever go away.Do you think that's her lurking over there?In that shadow that has been cast by me?Can you smell the witch?The witch is still alive.Can you smell the witch?I see her dead eyes.I wanted you to go away.Can you smell the witch?
Capture it, de-humanize it.You nurture it, you devour it.Promise it, you lie to it.And you doubt in it.See yourself in it.Twist the knife, watch as it dies.Be loved by it, but ignoring it.You feel the hate in it, escape from it.Laugh at it, ridicule it.Misunderstand, spit at it.Twist the knife, watch as it dies.You steal away it's life,Twist the knife, watch as it dies.Untouched my its cries.Twist the knife.

Out in the garden there's half of a heavenWe're only bluffingWe're not ones for busting through wallsBut they've told usUnless we can prove that we're doing itWe can't have it allHe's gonna wangle a way to get out of itShe's an excuseAnd a witness who'll talk when he's called,But they've told usUnless we can prove that we're doing itWe can't have it allWe can't have it all[Spoken]I've got a glimpse of a godAll shining and brightSuddenly my feet are feet of mudIt all goes slow-moI don't know why I'm cryingAm I suspended in gaffa?Not till I'm ready for youNot till I'm ready for youCan I have it allI try to get nearer

She locked her fingers and bowed her headShe said, "I'm late and I'm really scared"Now you can go but I hope you stayI'm gonna keep it either wayIn my daddy's El CaminoIn her driveway in the rainStarin' through that windshieldI could see my future changeAnd my heart hit like a hammerAnd my thoughts were runnin' wildAny fool can make a babyBut it takes a man to raise a child
The very deepest of your wishes.Climb up high, take my hand.Tread carefully through these sickening angels.Look at your god.Look at the way he stands.The uterine murderess dies herself.Let me show you all my pain.Sardonyx lays waste to your eyes and leaves you blind.Gone is the day.
I've seen them.So dark.Black.And yet fine.The flower they carry had once been mine.Get away from me, man of stories.Robe of lies.
See the light and feel my warm desire, run through my veins like the evening sun.It will live but no eyes will see it.I'll bless your name before I die.No person in everything can shine, yet shine you did, for the world to see.All a man hath will he give for life?For life that's lost bleeds all over me.I'd fallen before but it never hurt like this.Don't leave me here to crawl through the mire.I'm without fault before the throne of god.Take from me the crown of sympathy.What do you think you'll see?
So little of what we observe, is the girl herself.Elaborate, scented coiffers.Adieu d'amour.Vast is the heirs ballroom.Let the rich give you presents.Heaven pours from her throat, as she sings and as she dances.The fumes of rich swine, honeyglazed and dripping, playing in the air.My mouth eager and wishing.But I return to this nightingale.Her hair all fiery red.
Tonight I could be with youOr waiting in the WingsLift your heart with soaring songCut down the puppet stringsCut down the puppet stringsI wear a coat of drumsAnd dance upon your eyesTurn the tables upside downChange the lows to highsChange the lows to highsI fill you up with butterfliesCrown the heads of kingsBe glad of first night nervesFor fear gives courage wingsFear gives courage wings

A turning tideLovers at a great divideWhy do you laugh?When I know that you hurt inside?And why do you say?It's just another dayNothing in my wayI don't want to goI don't want to staySo, there's nothing left to sayAnd why do you lie?When you want to dieWhen you hurt inside
I don't wanna be adoredDon't wanna be first in lineOr make myself heardI'd like to bring a little lightTo shine a light on your lifeTo make you feel lovedNo, I don't wanna be the only one you knowI want to be the place you call homeI lay myself down to make it soBut you don't want to know

When i'm alone in my roomSometimes i stare at the wallAnd at the back of my mind i hear my conscious callTelling me i need a boy who's as sweet as a doveFor the first time in my life, i see i need loveThere i was giggling about the games that i had played with many heartsAnd i'm not sayin' no names.Then the thought occurred, tear drops made my eyes burnAs i said to myself when am i gonna learn?I can feel it inside, i can't explain how it feelsAll i know is that i'll never dish another raw dealPlayin' make believe, pretending that i'm true,Holding in my laugh as i say that i love you.Saying no more, kissing you on the ear,Whispering 'i love you and i'll always be here,Although i always reminisce, i can believe that i foundA desire for true love floating around inside my soulBecause my soul is cold, one half of me deserves to be this way

I met her in a snowstorm I was outdoors plowingShe just walked up to me and said "Hey boy how's it going?"I admired her straightforwardness and brushed away my fringeAs a signal of well being and excepting her challengeWe went home to her place and cooked up some chiliWarmed us from the inside 'cause the outside was chillyWe had to be quiet to not wake up her familyBut I made a high-pitch sound when her cold fingers touched meShe said:Schh, please be quietI know you don't want to but please deny itShe said:Schh, please be quietI know you don't want to but please deny it
Everyday make a fine loaf of breadAnd after work just before sunsetYou hang down to the city parkThere you're alone with the burbs in the darkAnd I've seen other people do that tooBut they're old and you're twenty-twoThey lost hope and soon they'll be goneThey'll just vanish with the setting sunBut I know, yes I know,
She said, "Let's put a plastic bag over our headsAnd then kiss and stuff till we get dizzy and fall on the bed."We were in Heaven for five or six minutes, then we passed outAnd I was so in love I thought I knew what love was all aboutIn church on Sunday making out in front of the preacherYou had a black shirt on with a big picture of NietzscheWhen we had done our thing for a full Christian hourI had made up my mind that there must be a higher power
I'm grindin' until I'm tiredThey say you ain't grindin' until you dieSo I'm grindin' with my eyes wideLookin' to find a way through the dayA life of the nightDear Lord it took so many of my people,
There will be no kisses tonightThere will be no holding hands tonight'Cause what is now wasn't there before and should not beI know I've broken some hearts, I understandSome firecrackers blow up in your handAnd while fucked up, I have always tried to be trueBut I would never kiss anyoneWho doesn't burn me like the sun
If I had to choose a moment in timeTo take with me into eternityI would choose this,This moment with you in my armsI know we've lost the final battleI know we are prisoners,I can hear chains rattleBut I'm a prisoner of this moment with you in my armsYou in my armsYou in my arms
I am leaving you because I don't love youI am leaving you because I don't love youOh it's the knowledge,It's the knowledge,It's the knowledgeOf future calamityThat makes my voice trembleWith greater dignity.
I saw on TV about this little kidWho had a pig for a petHis mom had once been attacked by a dogSo a pig was the closest thing he could getThis has of course nothing to do with anythingI just get so nervous when I'm talking to youAll I think about everyday is just kissing you
In a tiny, tiny southern Swedish country townTwo acres of field and a gas stationRiding on my moped, looking for funStaring into the blood-red sunOh, the country road is a boulevardWith neon lights and night-open barsIn my jacket, pack of playing cardsJust jacks, jokers, and a queen of heartsMy heart is beating, beating like RingoAs I pull into the drive-in bingoWhy do the people in the country want to look like the people in the cityWhen the people in the city aren't the slightest pretty?I want the people in the country to wear flannel shirtsAnd saggy jeans all covered in dirt
What's you're doing out in the night timeWhy'd you call me on the phoneYour mama can't solve your problemWhen's daddy ever get homeSo you did your little move and criedIn the middle of the suicideDon't close your eyesDon't close your eyesDon't sing your last lullaby
Some say loveIt is a riverThat drowns the tender reedSome say loveIt is a razorThat leaves your soul to bleedSome say loveIt is a hungerAn endless aching needI say loveIt is a flowerAnd you-it's only seed
Saying I love youIs not the words I want to hear from youIt's not that I want youNot to say, but if you only knewHow easy it would be to show me how you feelMore than words is all you have to do to make it realThen you wouldn't have to say that you love me'Cause I'd already knowWhat would you do if my heart was torn into?More than words to show you feelThat your love for me is realWhat would you say if I took those words away?
Another day without your smileAnother day just passes byAnd now I knowHow much it meansFor you to stay right here with meThe time we spent apartWill make our love grow strongerBut it hurts so badI can't take it any longerI wanna grow old with youI wanna die lying in your armsI wanna grow old with youI wanna be looking in your eyesI wanna be there for youSharing in everything you doI wanna grow old with you

If there's one thing In my life that's missingIt's the time that I spend aloneSailing on the cool and bright clear waterLots of those friendly peopleThey're showing me ways to goAnd I never want to lose their inspirationTime for a cool changeI know that it's time for a cool changeAnd now that my life is so prearrangedI know that it's time for a cool changeWell, I was born in the sign of waterAnd it's there that I feel my bestThe albatross and the whalesThey are my brothersIt's kind of a special feelingWhen you're out on the sea aloneStaring at the full moon like a loverTime, time for a cool change(Time for a cool change)
I'm caught in excitementAn unusual spellIt's pure in a senseAnd abstract from our livesAnd we talked a lot,Abstraction came into focusHer tales of the tourAnd a hardcore lifeWere unmatched by thePop sub-culture in mineAnd we talked a lotAnd soon it would come into focus(I tried to focus, I tried to focus! woah!)There's no time for fightingAny sex is personal
Casual sexIs it irrational? (Yes!)I think it's time to find out whyAnd soon I fall asleep, it's nighttimeIn a dream there's a dolphinAnd a soldier, they're walkingThrough the sand and toward a morgueIn an office there's a hostess who hasCarried our friendAnd wheeled him into a drawerShe pulls his fileThe air is cold
Left eye spins in circlesPassives line the railThey get no satisfactionFrom the electro-static breaksA beat can't cut the passives looseThey're afraid what we will sayNo harm is done when you try it then hideParts moving - keep moving
The night has fallen down the staircaseAnd I, for one, have felt its bruisesEquilbrium; inebriatedOur social graces have been displacedAs we sink deeper into the drinkThe volume increases...Night time resurrects fault linesSilent wars -- rumble somewhere belowThe surfaces verses...The surfaces verses...The shoe is dropped, lungs explodeShards of words of a shattered voice
There's a time and a placeThis is neither the time nor placeWhere do I fit inIn this jigsaw of a relationship?Why should I play the fall guy to your love?I keep getting snubbedWhat dumb luck, what dumb luckSo rub it in with your dumb lyricsYeah, that's the time and placeTo wring out your bullshitAnd each album I get shit on a little moreWho's Tim's latest whore?
This is the bed that i have madeThis is the grave where i will layThese are the hands where i will bury my faceI dont believe in wasting timeSearching for truth you never findNobody moves we live in the great decayAll these ghost towns share a nameAnywhere, usaAll these strangers look the sameDay after day after day
Your navel is yearning for an extension - a ghost limbIt cant detach from mothers loving graspYour starving - its burning for the nutrient it cant haveWere all cut off alone and lostCalling out to homebase, do you read me?(Emergency: were floating endlessly)Transmission terminatedYouve been created, severed from life and limb
Let's pretend were not needy.Let's pretend our hearts still beat.Let's pretend we fall in love tonight,Clumsy enough to fall for anything.We'll stumble on our words.We'll spill our guts on creaking bar stools,Below the neon blue.Low lives hiding in dives there's no feeling in drinking, sleeping with strangers.Ghosts passing through bedrooms unaware,
Hold your breath, dearThis ship is going downWe're all downhillRunning with our timebombsThese shins are cracked and splinteredThese lips are crusted shutThese squinting eyes just sting meThese veins are drying me upAll my limbsThey're just toolsWe're all stilted vechilesThese joints rust
My bulldog is barking in the backyardEnough to raise a dead man from his graveAnd I can't concentrate on what I'm doingDisturbance's going to crucify my daysAnd the days they get longer and longerAnd the night time is a time of little useFor I just get ugly and olderI get juiced on Mateus and just hang looseAnd I get bombed for breakfast in the morningI get bombed for dinner time and teaI dress in rags, smell a lot, and have a real good time
I walk behind youSo i can see youMove the way you do doMove the way you doDon't you know just to play with what you're givenDon't you know just to play with what you're givenCare taker for the only one to believe inWet road paradiseWet roads today
The sun and iAre rather close these daysThe sun and iAre rather close these daysI saw it firstYears agoIt was jumping highI loved it soIts eyes met mineIts eyes met mine
I want to tell you about something specialI want to tell you what makes men needI think I'm talking 'bout what we all get intoI think I'm talking 'bout love and greedYou can take it anyway but take it at your own speed'Cause you wouldn't be the first to fall to love and greedA man in love willing to walk through fireA greedy man like a moth to a flameA man in love willing to go half crazy
When you roll down your windowAnd ask for directionsCan you count on the answersThat you would receiveIf you've ever been takenBy that passed along pay backWhy ask in the first place you might not believeBut I won't be confined to road mapsOr let assholes decideAnd I'd rather be lostThen afraid to take a rideAnd if it's a singNo place on earth will I ever fit inAnd I don't mindSomeday I pray I just mayAs I make my wayWell I might have been helpfulOr a mischievous bastard
It doesn't matter what I saySo long as I sing with inflectionThat makes you feel I'll conveySome inner truth or vast reflectionBut I've said nothing so farAnd I can keep it up for as long as it takesAnd it don't matter who you areIf I'm doing my job then it's your resolve that breaksBecause the Hook brings you backI ain't tellin' you no lieThe Hook brings you backOn that you can relyThere is something amissI am being insincereIn fact I don't mean any of thisStill my confession draws you nearTo confuse the issue I referTo familiar heroes from long ago
When she wakes it seems so shadyShe remembers she's a ladyAh but could it be that maybeShe was having lots of funShe sees she's wearing leatherIn her navel there's a featherShe just has to crack a smileAnd close her eyes, her prayer begunLife I embrace youI shall honor and disgrace youPlease forgive if I replace youYou see I'm going through some painBut now I see clearlyAnd the dawn is coming nearlyAnd though I'm human and it's earlyI swear I'll never forget againAn explorer he went wanderingTo satisfy his ponderingBasically meandering
I just can't believe it girlI can't believe that it's overBut I'm your manAnd I'll be alrightBut stillThe love we hadStays on my mindLately babeI've been thinkingHow good it wasWhen you were hereAnd it ain't the wineThat I've been drinkingFor once I feel my headIs clearBut early this morningWhen I opened up my eyesThat old lonesome feelingTook me by surpriseI guess you meant more to meThan I realizedThe love we had stays on my mind(Stays on my mind)The love we had stays on my mindAnd lately girlI've been remembering
Looking through some photographs I found inside a drawerI was taken by a photograph of youThere were one or two I know that you would have liked a little moreBut they didn't show your spirit quite as trueYou were turning 'round to see who was behind youAnd I took your childish laughter by surpriseAnd at the moment that my camera happened to find youThere was just a trace of sorrow in your eyesNow, the things that I remember seem so distant and so smallThough it hasn't really been that long a timeWhat I was seeing wasn't what was happening at allAlthough for a while our path did seem to climbWhen you see through love's illusions, there lies the dangerAnd your perfect lover just looks like a perfect fool
I saw the light, I've been baptizedBy the fire in your touch and the flame in your eyesI'm born to love againI'm a brand new manWell, the whole town's talkin''Bout the line I'm walkin'That leads right to your doorOh how I used to roamI was a rolling stoneI used to have a wild sideThey say a country mile wideI'd burn those beer joints downThat's all changed nowYou turned my life around
"People see Rock & Roll as... As youth cultureAnd when youth culture becomes monopolized by big businessWhat are the youth to do?Do you...

There was a girl in ParisWhom he sent a letter toHoping she would answer backNow wasn't that a foolHardy notion on the part ofSometimes lonely musicianActing out a whim is only goodFor a condition of the heartThere was a dame from LondonWho insisted that he love her

Cover of "Zombie" by The CranberriesAnother head hangs lowly,Child is slowly taken.And the violence caused such silence,Who are we mistaken?But you see, it's not me, it's not my family.In your head, in your head they are fighting,With their tanks, and their bombs,And their bombs, and their guns.In your head, in your head, they are crying...
Blame you Hollywood,For showing me things you never shouldShow a young girl,In a cruel world.Because life's not a happy ending,I'm sure there is some,Like Johnny and June,And maybe other people too.They all would have been killedIn the sound of music,They would have found out that
I was standing on this sidewalk in 1945In Jacksonville, IllinoisWhen asked what my name was there came no replyThey said I was a deaf and sightless half-wit boyBut Lewis was my name though I could not say itI was born and raised in New OrleansMy spirit was wild so I let the river take itOn a barge and a prayer upstreamThey searched for a mother and they searched for a fatherAnd they searched till they searched no moreThe doctors put to rest their scientific testsAnd they named me John Doe No. 24And they all shook their heads in pityFor a world so silent and darkWell there's no doubt that life's a mystery

Watch the fire dieSee the snowflakes flyHear the geese out honking' on the bayFeel the fire's flameDo they sigh your nameThink of you, my love, so far awayOnce I never moved without youI held on to you all the timeBut now that I'm three days without youI feel a lot like cryin'
Your signal across the sky,Is trying to bridge the distance,And all of the reasons why,I'm so far away,I know you can move the time,And the space that falls between us,I know you can cross the lines,All I can say is,Break them down(Chorus:)You are what's turning my world around,Moving me close in the moment with a single motion,Even when all of my stars are falling,
I've got the dress, i've got the ringI've got a song that i can singI've got the bread, i've got the wineBut i've got the life i've left behindI've got everything, but i've got nothingWithout youI've got the law on my heartI've got your love tearing me apartI've got a vow that I can't keepBut I've got your promise getting me to sleep
I feel sometimesThat she's not missed at allI feel sometimesThat she's been left behindI feel sometimesThat she's neglectedI feel this timeThat she will riseWhy has her life been dismissed?Somebody tell meWhy has her life been dismissed?Cold December day, I walk in well there, there she lay
It's nights like these.They make em sleep all day.It's nights like theseThat make you feel so far away.It's nights like theseNothing is for sure.It's nights like theseI dont want you anymore.Now I've only gotThis one wish,That I was good enough to make you forgetThe only boy who ever broke your heart,
She spreads herself wide open to let the insects inShe leaves a trail of honey to show me where she's beenShe has the blood of reptile just underneath her skinSeeds from a thousand others drip down from withinOh my beautiful liarOh my precious whoreMy disease my infectionI am so impure oh
I hurt myself todayTo see if I still feelI focus on my painThe only thing that's realThe needle tears a holeThe old familiar stingTry to kill it all awayBut I remember everythingWhat have I become?My sweetest friendEveryone I knowGoes away in the end
Wherever I goI take a little piece of youI collect, I rejectPhotos I took of youWell, times that I passed throughSo many faces, so many placesI have got to have a memoryI have never been thereI have never been thereI have never had youI have never had youI have never had youI have never had youI have never had youI have never had youI have never had youI have never had youI have never had youI can't rememberGive me your reminder
I beat my machineIt's a part of meIt's inside of meI'm stuck in this dreamIt's changing meI am becomingThe me that you know, he had some second thoughtsHe's covered with scabsHe is broken and soreThe me that you knowHe doesn't come around muchThat part of me...Isn't here anymoreAll pain disappearsIt's the nature of...Of my circuitryDrowns out all I hearNo escape from this
In a hand painted night, me and Gypsy Scotty are partnersAt the Hotel Flamingo, wearin black market shoesThis loud Cuban band is crucifying John LennonNo one wants to be lonely, no one wants to sing the bluesShe's perched like a parrot on his tuxedo shoulderChrist, what's she doing with him she could be dancing with meShe stirs the ice in her glass with her elegant fingerI want to be what she's drinking, yeah I just want to beI saw you firstI'm the first one tonightI saw you firstDon't that give me the right
Breathing from a hole in my lungI had no oneBut faces in front of meRacing through the void in my headTo find tracesOf a good luck academyOoh, Ooh, OohSparks ignite and trade them for thoughtAbout no oneAnd nothing in particularWashed the sickened socket and droveResent nothingThere's good will inside of meOoh, Ooh, OohWake me up lower the feverWalking in a straight line

Don't cry to meIf you loved meYou would be here with meYou want meCome find meMake up your mindShould I let you fall, lose it all?So maybe you can remember yourselfCan't keep believingWe're only deceiving ourselvesAnd I'm sick of the lieAnd you're too lateDon't cry to me
Feels like the weight of the worldLike God in heaven gave me a turnDon't cling to me, I swear I can't fix youStill in the dark, can you fix me?Freefall, freefall, all through lifeIf you love me, then let go of meI won't be held down by who I used to be
Lithium, don't wanna lock me up insideLithium, don't wanna forget how it feels withoutLithium, I wanna stay in love with my sorrowOh, but God I wanna let it goCome to bed, don't make me sleep aloneCouldn't hide the emptiness, you let it showNever wanted it to be so coldJust didn't drink enough to say you love meI can't hold on to me
Stoplight, lock the doorDon't look backUndress in the darkAnd hide from you, all of youYou'll never know the way your words have haunted meI can't believe you'd ask these things of meYou don't know meNo one everYou belong to me, my snow white queenThere's nowhere to run, so let's just get it overSoon I know you'll see, you're just like meDon't scream anymore, my love, 'cause all I want is you
Out on your ownCold and alone againCan this be what you really wanted, baby?Blame it on meSet your guilt freeNothing can hold you back nowNow that you're gone
Stay lowSoft, dark, and dreamlessFar beneath my nightmares and lonelinessI hate me for breathing without youI don't want to feel anymore for youGrieving for youI'm not grieving for youNothing real love can't undoAnd though I may have lost my wayAll paths lead straight to youI long to be like youLie cold in the ground like you
You don't remember my nameI don't really careCan we play the game your way?Can I really lose control?Just once in my lifeI think it'd be nice
I can't see your starI can't see your starThough I patiently waited bedside for the death of todayI can't see your starAnd the mechanical lights of Lisbon frightened it awayAnd I'm alone nowMe and all I stood forWe're wandering nowAll in parts, and pieces swim lonelyFind your own way outI can't see your star
Under your spell againI can't say no to youCrave my heart and its bleeding in your handI can't say no to youShouldn't have let you torture me so sweetlyNow I can't let go of this dreamI can't breathe but I feelGood enoughI feel good enough for you
Now I will tell you what I've done for you50,000 tears I've criedScreaming, deceiving and bleeding for youAnd you still won't hear me (Going under)Don't want your hand this time, I'll save myselfMaybe I'll wake up for once (Wake up for once)Not tormented daily defeated by youJust when I thought I'd reached the bottomI'm dying againI'm going under (Going under)Drowning in you (Drowning in you)I'm falling forever (Falling forever)
How can you see into my eyes, like open doors?Leading you down into my coreWhere I've become so numbWithout a soul (soul)My spirit's sleeping somewhere coldUntil you find it there and lead it back home(Wake me up) Wake me up inside(I can't wake up) Wake me up inside(Save me) Call my name and save me from the dark(Wake me up) Bid my blood to run(I can't wake up) Before I come undone(Save me) Save me from the nothing I've becomeNow that I know what I'm withoutYou can't just leave meBreathe into me and make me real
Perfect by natureIcons of self indulgenceJust what we all needMore lies about a world thatNever was and never will beHave you no shame?Don't you see me?You know you've got everybody fooledLook, here she comes nowBow down and stare in wonder
I'm so tired of being hereSuppressed by all my childish fearsAnd if you have to leaveI wish that you would just leave'Cause your presence still lingers hereAnd it won't leave me aloneThese wounds won't seem to healThis pain is just too realThere's just too much that time can not eraseWhen you cried, I'd wipe away all of your tearsWhen you'd scream, I'd fight away all of your fears
Long lost words whisper slowly to meStill can't find what keeps me hereWhen all this time I've been so hollow insideI know you're still thereWatching me, wanting meI can feel you pull me down
I tried to kill the painBut only brought more (so much more)I lay dyingAnd I'm pouring crimson regret and betrayalI'm dying, praying, bleeding and screamingAm I too lost to be saved?Am I too lost?My God, my TourniquetReturn to me salvationMy God, my TourniquetReturn to me salvationDo you remember me?
You don't remember me but I remember youI lie awake and try so hard not to think of youBut who can decide what they dream?And dream I doI believe in youI'll give up everything just to find youI have to be with youTo live, to breatheYou're taking over meHave you forgotten all I knowAnd all we had?
Hold on to me, loveYou know I can't stay longAll I wanted to say was I love you and I'm not afraidOh, can you hear me?Can you feel me in your arms?Holding my last breathSafe inside myselfAre all my thoughts of youSweet raptured lightIt ends here tonightI'll miss the winterA world of fragile thingsLook for me in the white forest
Catch me as I fallSay you're here and it's all over nowSpeaking to the atmosphereNo one's here and I fall into myselfThis truth drives me into madnessI know I can stop the pain if I will it all awayIf I will it all awayDon't turn away (Don't give in to the pain)Don't try to hide (Though they're screaming your name)Don't close your eyes (God knows what lies behind them)Don't turn out the light (Never sleep, never die)I'm frightened by what I seeBut somehow I know that there's much more to comeImmobilized by my fearAnd soon to be blinded by tearsI can stop the pain if I will it all awayIf I will it all away
I took their smiles and I made them mineI sold my soul just to hide the lightAnd now I see what I really amA thief, a whore, and a liarI run to you(Run away from this Hell)Call out your name(Giving up, giving in)I see you there(Still you are farther away)Farther awayI'm numb to you, numb and deaf and blindYou give me all but the reason whyI reach but I feel only air at nightNot you, not love, just nothing

Bop bop.Care about the moonlightAnd holding you tightAnd asking my questions.Everyone loves a situation.Long walks on the beach.The press will impeach.Lately I'm findingI am the book and you are the binding.I guess they'll read everything about you.Though the press might shoot me down I'm still true.I sell my book for free. That's what you do to me.
Another night slips away.In other words I should sayThere are no words he should say.There are no words.In his eyes I see the fearThat only time can disappear.If only time could reappear.Now's the time.Something to take it away.To take it away. To take it.Don't let it stay.Don't let it stay. Don't let it.The butterflies are passive/aggressiveAnd put their problems on the shelfBut they're beautiful.
Sometimes I wonder if you're still hereLooking out for anything that couldFall and hit your head.Fluorescent lights burn out in time dear.We see the world in a different light.Did you give up?Love is supposed to be this bad.Make you cry mega-ultra sad.If I told you you're all I ever had would you walk on me?Because I wouldn't walk on you.If I was in your shoes I wouldn't walk all over you.
I need a new direction to get me around.You don't have protection as you're coming down.Light my white candle keep me safe.It'll put that smile back on my face. ya.Have you made up your mind?It's the only way.Have you made it up? Have you made it up?I admire the time that you take.Have you made it up? Have you made it up?I still think we should meditate.I need a good luck charm to give me good luck.I need a good alarm to wake me up.
Let me get lost.I'll drive you around 'til I run out of gas.Find me a boss.There are ripples in my tea cause anEarthquake's coming.And there's people meeting on MarsAnd people driving in their carsAnd kids are laughing under the stars today.Let me go hide.Find a box to put BK inside.Things are so well.We're blowing shit up only you could tell.And there's people meeting on Mars
Sign me up I volunteer.Votes are in for lifeguard of the year.Her feline past lives are plain.Their singularities are shown in this life again.Like mamma said,"Don't you let it go to your headWhen you know you're being fed."I'm so proud to know you.Lizzy I'll write, I'll sing,Telegraph, telegram, telephone, tellin' youI'll be home soon. Dienu.
I don't stand a chance in this fucked up world.New school took romance and messed it up real bad.But your brand new eyes shrink me to a size.Make it hard to see my reality.You say I'm blind.I think you're wrong.Harriet's got a song.When we combineNothing goes wrong.Harriet's got a song.

La la la la la.We are just a sexual making me an alcoholic relation.Words hit much harder than the bullets from a gun,A shovel to the skull, a stab in the spine.Be my valentine, you don't have to say much.This machine is so mature, it's so much your type.(Boy) "You be Betty!"(Girl) "I'll be Betty!"(Boy) "I'll play Joe!"(Girl) "You play Joe!"We'll crawl out of my window, honey,
"I want to kill this manBut he turned around ran.I'll kill him with karate that i learned in japan.He wouldn't see my face, i wouldn't leave a traceI would'nt use a bullet cause i bullet's a discrace.Aw, mom, i never though that i was a murdering manBut tonight i'm on my way.There's this drawer that i know in a house up the roadThat's full of things that are easily sold.When they go out of town i could go and snoop aroundAnd make myself rich off the things i'd foundAw, mom i never thought that i was a stealing man

When you're hurt, you heal others.When you're in need, you give.Because of you, I am livingThe most that I can live.Oh, sweet darlin' girlI'm so glad you found me.Oh, sweet darlin' girlYour power surrounds me.Remember me, don't forget me.I have something true.My path is dark, my steps uncertainUnless I walk with you.
Breaking the Rubik's cubeMaking me lose the beatBlue jean-baby girlWe are an apogeeDown in the Christmas treeHear me outYou don't know I'm hereI want it all too soon,Faster than laser beams
There's no time to phone home when you'reRacing your own time.We contemplate, you gotta wait your own turn.Up the noise, with some poison with great poise.You can't compare it to...Or let it scare you through...If every thing you do is not as smoothly as we planned.You gotta understand there is more for you.But all you gotta do is put yourself with the people,They're the ones who make the world spin.Lust in favor, you can win.

Darling, give me your absence tonightTake the shade from the canvas and leave me theWhiteLet me sink in the silence that echoes insideAnd don't bother leaving the light onCause I suddenly feel like a different personFrom the roots of my soul comes a gentle coersionAnd I ran my hand o'er a strange inversion --A vacancy that just did not belong

I just left Bobby's house:The service was today.Got me thinkin' about how fragile life is,As I drove away.You know Amy was his only love,In a moment she was gone, long gone:It could have been me or you.Oh, baby, there's no time to lose.So I'm gonna bring home a dozen roses,An' pour us a glass of wine.An' I'm gonna put on a little music,An' turn down the lights.An' I'm gonna wrap my arms around you,An' rock you all through the night,An' I'm gonna love you,Like it's the last day of my life.

Blank page was all the rageNever meant to say anythingIn bed I was half deadTired of dreaming of restGot dressed drove the state lineLooking for you at the five and dimeStop sign told me stay at homeTold me you were not aloneBlank page was all the rageNever meant to hurt anyoneIn bed I was half deadTired of dreaming of restYou haven't changed
I wish I lived in the Golden Age, giving it up on the Broadway stage.Hang with the rats and smoke cigars, have a break with Frank and count the stars.Dressed to the nines, we've had to much. Shiny jewels, casino cash.Tapping feet, wanna take the lead.

There was a decorated General with a heart of goldThat likened him to all the stories he toldOf past battles won and lostAnd legends of oldA seasoned veteran in his own timeOn the battlefield he gained respectful fameWith many medals of bravery and stripes to his nameHe grew a beard as soon as he could to cover the scars on his faceAnd always urged his men onBut on the eve of a great battle with the infantry in dreamThe Old General tossed in his sleep and wrestled with its meaningHe awoke from the night to tell what he had seenAnd walked slowly out of his tentAll the men held tall with their chests in the airWith the courage in their blood and a fire in their stareAnd it was a gray morning and they all wondered how they would fareTill the old general told them to go homeHe said, "I have seen the othersAnd I have discoveredThat this fight is not worth fightingAnd I've seen their mothers

This train don't stop at the stations of the crossNo reasons left to believeTrying to stay awake gave yourself a caffeine headacheTo hide the taste of sleepIn choosing to forget you cut away the safety net that holds your heart, holds your heartAnd you go in search of youth touching up your empire rootsBut these days we don't know how to marchSatisfied with a knife in your spine you're bloodlessSo tell me again what am I feeling you know me so wellSo what am I feeling and how can you tellI've got a feeling you don't know

Ice has formedAnd there's snow between the tracksAnd I have seen the surface tear andI can't look backAnd cool low sunHas blinded you for daysFrom horizon to horizonCan I dream this all awayBut over the waterOver the waterOver the seaThere's you shining bright
I confessI confess I was wrongTasted blood tasted blood and was goneSuddenly suddenly you were warnedShooting stars in flight from the dawnI'm the breath on your faceYou think you are safeI am watching youI'm the voice that you hearWhen no one is nearI am watching you'Cause you're in the lineLine of fireSouthern skiesSouthern skies shrink my world
The picture is burned at the edgeAnd you're looking awayLooking for what's nextAnd strange how through time we look the sameYour eyes and mine looking awayToo scared to see human remainsAnd soon enough soon enoughThis will all be a memoryAnd soon enough soon enoughThis will fade like the photographOf you and me
Doesn't anybody feelThat all these killers should be killedAnd all these healers should be healedSo all these beggars can be filledAnd now tell me why am I to lieIf I'm holding firm and feel the rightTo lie beside this dog of mineAnd let that perverted thought really run through my mindThrough my mindAh-ooo-ahAh-ooo-ah

I stood at the door beside herBut she wouldn't let me passI was such a bore and I lied to herI said I didn't really want her assI went away in the mud and rainThe gang became snide and laughedI was slayed but I smiled and the painBegan to subside at lastAnd when I got back to my hotelI wondered if the thunder meant I'd landed in hellAnd on the forecourt, I slipped and fellI cracked my stupid head and I heard a bellI thought, heySomebody saved me, it happened againSomebody saved me, I thank you, my friendSomebody saved me, from a fate worse than heaven'Cause if I'd had her for just an hourI'd have wanted her foreverSomebody saved meYou would have thought that I'd have learnedTwenty years ago or moreA beautiful girl raised her mouth and yearnedBut I didn't know what lips were forI ran away in the mud and rain
I was gonna clean my room until I got highI was gonna get up and find the broom but then I got highMy room is still messed up and I know why'Cause I got highBecause I got highBecause I got highI was gonna go to class before I got highI coulda cheated and I coulda passed but I got highI am taking it next semester and I know why'Cause I got highBecause I got highBecause I got highI was gonna go to court before I got highI was gonna pay my child support but then I got high
Watch her as she flew deep within the blueThe day out from the county ICUThere's nothing you can doSomeone gently says to youThe doctor says that now it won't be longI try and live up til the moment and I hope that I don't blow itAnd what is it in me that she hears?It's just a song she likesHer little arms around my neckAnd a dying girl whispers in my earTell me now can you feel it?I've been keeping company with ghostsShe comes to me like a piece of summerShe comes to me on the days when I need it most
Just when the days start getting colderI walk the streets I never knewAnd theres some words I never told youThe sound rings out like the truthAnd if you could seeWhat's come over meThen you would knowCause I'm walkin' freeThe wind at my backBathed in afterglowAnd as I sit here in this dark roomAll I seem to feel is lightAnd I see color
Oh oh ohOh oh ohGotta get a littleGotta get a littleAll the world has gone to bedAnd I am drowning in it's silenceBut a solitude is in my head, from you, maybeAnd if the silence was a songWell, its rhythm grooves and it's a private radioAnd on this night I did belongIn harmonyAnd you can't deny meAnd you will oblige meIt's my melodyWhen the night comes
Half a week before the winterThe chill bites before it comesI'm a child of the pleasureDaddy brings before he runsHe sits behind a desk of mahoganyHe whispers dreams into my earAnd though I've givin' him his empireHe delivers me my fearThe unicorns are riding highPowerful in coats of white
I've been takin' what you're givin'Now I'm thinkin' I've been livin'The fantasy of your sweet smileSad as blue and blue as onlyYou could cast the color on meCan you see my fire redMmm... Mmm.C'est la vieC'est la vie here in my lonelyC'est la vieC'est la vie here in my lonely without him
Look upLook where you wanna beLook leftLook where he left meI should've knownBy the ice in his eyeBut you warm me up with your so sweet demiseAnd nestled in your calculated moon shineBoy you give goodLove, plastic loveYou're a genuine wannabe
Watching puddles gather rainThere's no better place to layShe's as fine as dandelions blowin' in the windShe's not thinkin' about anythingShe floatsShe floatsFloatsWearin' black patent Mary JanesShe steps out into the rainShe's as dry as clear blue skiesSwallowing you whole
Well I'm standing by a riverBut the water doesn't flowIt boils with every poison you can think ofAnd I'm underneath the streetlightsBut the light of joy I knowScared beyond belief way down in the shadowsAnd the perverted fear of violence
A heaven, a gateway, a hopeJust like the feeling inside, it's no jokeAnd though it hurts me to treat you this wayBetrayed by words i've never heard, too hard to sayUp, down, turn aroundPlease don't let me hit the groundTonight, I think I'll walk aloneI'll find my soul as I go homeUp, down, turn aroundPlease don't let me hit the groundTonight, I think I'll walk aloneI'll find my soul as I go homeOoooo x 8

This girl is a stencil of a brushstroke in the rainShe's a ghost of the city, she's a body through the windscreenThis girl is the snowfall where the spring should have beenShe's the stains on the pages of a top shelf magazineThis girl is a black eye, she's a bruise on your kneeShe's the ashes of the people that you really meant to beThis girl's the resurrection, she's the comebackShe's the absinthe and whiskey, she is poetry and ProzacThis girl is taking bets, this girl's a silhouette, can't you see?
Something infests me when I'm aloneIt's lunacyI want to vomit, spit out my lifeSo queer it seemsRetract your reverence and slander meI'm the traitor of mineA close-up picture of my lost chastityThere's nothing left of me anymore
Once I travelled seven seas to find my loveAnd once I sang seven hundred songsWell, maybe I still have to walk seven thousand milesUntil I find the one that I belongI will rest my head side by sideTo the one that stays in the nightI will lose my breath in my last words of sorrowAnd whatever comes will come soonDying I will pray to the moonThat there once will be a better tomorrow
I dress myself in blackIn black from head to heelsI take my promise backCause you don't know how it feelsNo, you don't take me as I amNo, you don't want to know at allWho is the face behind the maskI'll be the one who'll make you fallBeware! Beware! I'll be the oneThe one to take you underBeware!I hate the light of day
The wounds on your handsNever seem to healI thought all I needed was to believeHere am I, a lifetime away from YouThe blood of Christ or the beat of my heartMy love wears forbidden coloursMy life believes
Now beware the streets tonightLay low 'till the sunriseThe undead casanova's hunt for love(You may)Lock the doors, drop the blindsKeep quiet and stay insideBut nothing helps when push comes to shoveBequeath the loving - My body's coldI take you in my coffin where you can kiss my bonesOn the Night of the loving deadLove the un-living, no skins attachedOn the Night of the loving deadThe Night of the loving dead
Just for spiteEvery day, every nightYou still wonder, you wonderFrom the ashes I riseBy the roll of the diceYou'll go under, go underYou never realizedI'm back here to stayLike a fungus that grows on your sideYou never realized I won't go awayNot tonightI'll never leave you lonelyI'll be there tryin' to grab a hold, yeahI'm not the nicest guy you know
The way you wear your hatThe way you sip your teaThe memory of all thatNo, no, they can't take that away from meThe way your smile just beamsThe way you sing off keyThe way you haunt my dreamsNo, no, they can't take that away from meWe may never, never meet againOn the bumpy road to loveStill I'll always, always keep the memory of
The city feels clean this time of nightJust empty streets and me walking homeTo clear my head, I know it came as no surpriseI'm affected more than I had guessed by what was saidIf this love's not meant to beIf a heart's not ready to openIf the naked eye won't seeIt's brokenIf this love's not meant to beIf a heart's not ready to openIf the naked eye won't seeOh, it's brokenIt's a quiet time before the dawnAnd I'm half past making sense of it
I wanna have some funI just wanna have a lttle funLike this...Fellows, you wanna have a little fun?How about a lttle brush work Knuckles?Let's brush this shit outWake up the dying, don't wake up the deadChange what your sayin', don't change what you saidNow that its time, that I got out of bedWhen I walk myself, down Sycamore StreetThe sun beats down, no shoes on my feet
Maybe you want to give me kisses sweetBut only for one night with no repeatMaybe you'll go away and never callAnd a taste of honey is worse than none at allOh little girlIn that case I don't want no partI do believe that would only break my heart
Do you know where you're going toDo you like the things that life is showing youWhere are you going toDo you knowDo you getWhat you're hoping forWhen you look behind youThere's no open doorsWhat are you hoping forDo you knowOnce we were standing still in timeChasing the fantasiesThat filled our mindsYou knew how I loved youBut my spirit was free(M. Masser and G. Goffin)Do you know where you're going toDo you like the things that life is showing youWhere are you going toDo you knowDo you getWhat you're hoping forWhen you look behind youThere's no open doorsWhat are you hoping forDo you know
Today's special is Memphis Soul StewWe sell so much of this, people wonder what we put in it
And I awokeOnly to find my lungs emptyAnd through the night, so it seems I'm not breathingAnd now my dreams are nothing like they were meant to beAnd I'm breaking down, I think I'm breaking downAnd I'm afraid, to sleep because of what haunts meSuch as living with the uncertaintyThat I'll never find the words to say which would completely explainJust how I'm breaking down
How much would you betThat if I tried hard enoughI would spontaneously combust?I wish I could disappearAnd run away from all of my fears.I think I'm coming undone.So stay the night.
You need not to climb mountain topsYou need not to cross the seaYou need not to find a cureFor everything that makes you weakYou need not to reach for the starsWhen life becomes so darkAnd when the wind does blow against the grainYou must follow your heartYou must follow your heart
A woman left lonelyWill soon grow tired of waitingShe'll do crazy thingsOn lonely occasionsA simple conversationWith a new man now and againMakes a touchy situationWhen a good thing's comin' to an end
Trust in me, baby, give me time, gimme time, um gimme time.I heard somebody say, oh, "The older the grape,Sweeter the wine, sweeter the wine."Oh, my love is like a seed, baby, just needs time to grow,It's growing stronger day by day, yeah,That's the price you've got to pay.Trust in me, baby, give me time, gimme time, please, a little more time.Takes a road runner just a little bit uh-longer, dear,Oh, to make up my mind, I gotta make up my mind.
We break our enemies with fear, andWe've seen how the tears come aroundWe've built our confidence on wastelandWe've seen how the walls come downLife burns!A man dies like a butterflyLife burns from the touch of the reaperAll things must passOne love is a crooked lieThe world lies in the hands of evilWe pray it would lastLife burns!We have no sympathy for the lost soulsWe've chosen the path of disgrace
Standing outside, looking out for meI know I've done nothing wrongThere's plenty of time for us to seeStart cleaning up the mess we've doneWe keep on living our livesWith stupidityAs if we've got something to loseSo much selfish tranquilityJust for the sakeOf trying nothing newAnd IThink IShould be the oneTo make a stand
His time there so long.His fingers traced the endless walls he knew so well.And there the breaths were short and hard and thick with salt.And in this place he always knew he'd wake alone.Hands clutch in panic.
This is how we do it...This is how we do it!This is how we do it!This is how we do it...It's Friday night, and I feel all rightThe party is here on the WestsideSo I reach for my 40 and I turn it upDesignated driver take the keys to my truckHit the shore 'cause I'm fadedHoneys in the street say, "Monty, yo we made it!"It feels so good, in my hood, tonightThe summertime skirts and the guys in KaniAll the gang bangers forgot about the drive byYou gotta get your groove on, before you go get paidSo tip up your cup and throw your hands upAnd let me hear the party sayI'm kinda buzzed and it's all because (This is how we do it)South Central does it like nobody does (This is how we do it)To all my neighbors you got much flavor (This is how we do it)Let's flip the track, bring the old school back (This is how we do it)
Slowly surelyI walk away from that old desperate, and tainted loveCaught up in a maze of loveA crazy, crazy loveThought it was good, thought it was realThought it was but it wasn't loveI just don't knowWhere I should goSo slowly surelyI walk away from self-serving, undeserving,Constantly hurting me loveDeserting me loveYou said, I said, We saidButSlowly surelyI walk away from confusing loveMisusing love, abusing love
Time can never mendThe careless whisper of a good friendTo the heart and mind ignorance is kindThere's no comfort in the truthPain is all you'll findI'm never gonna dance againGuilty feet have got no rhythmThough it's easy to pretendI know you're not a foolI should have known better than to cheat a friendAnd waste a chance that I've been givenSo I'm never gonna dance againThe way I danced with youShould have known better, ooh...I feel so unsureAs you take my handAnd lead me to the dance floorAs the music diesSomething in your eyesCalls to mind a silver screen
(John cale)Virgin mary was tiredSo tiredTired of listening to gossipGossip and complaintsThey came from next doorAnd a bewildered stream of chatterFrom all sorts ofAll sorts ofUntidy whores
Baby I'm hot just like an ovenI need some lovin'And baby, I can't hold it much longerIt's getting stronger and strongerAnd when I get that feelingI want Sexual HealingSexual Healing, babyMakes me feel so fineHelps to relieve my mindSexual Healing baby, is good for meSexual Healing is something that's good for me

If time is my vesselThen learning to love might be my way back to seaThe flying, the metal, the turning aboveThese are just ways to be seenWe all get paidYeah, some get faith before they dieThen through stars we will navigateThrough the holes in your eyesHow many days will it take to land?How many ways to reach abandon?
If you only knew all the problemsThat a man like me has to face.If you only knew all the sillyThings that keep a man from his place.I wouldn't want to sing your own song.Your gonna have to lose a few.If you only knew.If you only knew all the dealing

Oh the warm feelingAs we sat beside the seaOh the warm feeling as i sat by youLike a child within the kingdomAs we sat beside the seaOh the warm feeling as i sat by you
Some days it gets completely crazyAnd I feel like howlin' at the moonThen sometimes it feels so easyLike I was born with a silver spoonOther times you just can't reach meSeem like I've got a heart of stoneGuess I need my solitudeAnd I have to make it on my ownWell, I guess I'm going A.W.O.LDisconnect my telephoneJust like Greta GarboI just want to be aloneNeed to make some real connectionBaby, something's just got to give
Heart and soul, body and mindHeart and soul, body and mindHeart and soul, body and mindMeet me on the river of time(Meet me on the river of time)Meet me on the river of timeBrother of mine, sister of mineBrother of mine, sister of mine
Jane became insaneNa na na, na naNa na na, na naJane became insaneNa na na, na naNa na na, na naShe's a high class fellaThere's something 'bout her that you don't understandShe got me raffled up and ready to goShe got everything under controlShe got everything under control, control, controlI see her and then she starts to undressWith a smile that you will never forgetComin' down with the clash to connectShe was out and now she's out for success
Well, I got my mind out of sightLost the common sense,Got a rave in my brainLike i'm without defense.Till I catch my eyes right in front of me,It's a bloke of a man, fine as he can be.Hey cute from the left, oh yeahWhy'd his move he had me shake out a lieHe really had it going...The crowd's getting thinnerWe are getting closer,With a hole in my headHe took me to his sofa...Well now the sun ain't shining no more,I don't know why but I've seen it before.Ain't got no joy no man to lean on,He leaves my soul on the floor like a doll.He was young, he was hot,
Oh I've just comeFrom the land of the sunFrom a war that must be wonIn the name of truthWith our soldiers so braveYour freedom we will saveWith our rifles and grenadesAnd some help from GodI want to see my familyMy wife and child waiting for meI've got to go homeI've been so alone, you see
We all feel the sameAll pleasure nothing to gainI've known you from the startI've grown used to your wooden heartNow you know my nameYou search your empty brain in vainIf you don't change your waysYou'll end up here with me ungracedWithout you they'll never knowWithout you my life won't flowWithout you they'll never showWithout you the night won't goWithout you I'm left aloneWithout you I'm on my own
Wake upAnd listen to the wavesIs there a wordThat could wash away your tears at your will?Stand upAnd listen to the windIs there a momentYou can sit down and stay still?
Sometimes... so strange... cut up the painSome thing... arrange... always the sameCome into the scene... closer... and please smile againCome for a walk... together... in this wastelandThese comforting words i'd want to hear...I'm only dreamingThis is the moment i was waiting forI was burning to welcome you into my worldSo tired of crossing you path once moreI thought we'd walk the same way after all
InvincibleI was born a fragment of futureRaised by the dawn of existenceI grew as one with the elementsShown the cause of extinctionI have seen worlds bloom to explode
The energy of the wisdom hazeRinses the tide as a blend of fireUpon the shores, where fires blazeThe pulse of time, shades of lightPlains Stroked by the slumber sleepMountains embraced by rafting time
Moving forward; moving fasterAnd every day, it growsForcing these scavengers toTrail in its wakeFeeding upon the scrapsOf torn paperAnd leftover changeCharging forwardWe watch as it passesCrushing everything in its pathNothing can ever stop this campaignNot when everything
Gathered round the wooden tableSame tavern as the nights beforeI brace myself against the gableSunlight pushes its way through the gap in the doorAs the golden sunbeams reach my eyesI stand up and raise my pint up highOne more for our brothers who fought beside usOne more and forward againOnce more, we'll fight and conquerUntil we'll meet againStaring at the stools not takenI reach for my tankard of aleThe silence remains unbrokenAll you hear is a tinkle of mailAs the golden sunbeams reach my eyesI stand up and raise my pint up highOne more for our brothers who fought beside usOne more and forward againOnce more, we'll fight and conquer
Nothing hurts like the truth, a piece of perfidy, a deceitful behaviour,Women's lures, deserted like an empty corpse, an uneasy conscience.Stigmatised in hell, he's puffed up with conceit,There will come a day of retribution, they're just lost dreams,
I'm driving home for ChristmasOh, I can't wait to see those facesI'm driving home for Christmas, yeahWell, I'm moving down that lineAnd it's been so longBut I will be thereI sing this songTo pass the time awayDriving in my carDriving home for ChristmasIt's gonna take some time, but I'll get thereTop to toe in tailbacksOh, I got red lights all aroundBut soon there'll be a freeway, yeah
They exchanged a lookAn hour later her voice shookWhen her whispering died, she criedNever wants to recover, she criedDon't talk to me about love(Yesterdays shatter, tomorrows don't matter)Don't talk to me about love(Yesterdays shatter, tomorrows don't matter)Since that gazeRoaring by went her days
Standing in front of the mirrorAnd everything seems to be wrongAll I see is a pale, ugly womanToo tired to anything against itYou turn up and lead me back on my wayBecause I went astrayYou just treat me like a princessAnd I start to feel like itIf I could see me through your eyesIf I could touch me with your handsIf I could smell me with your noseWhat would I be like?
Thoughts running through my headShivering autumn breezeOutside the windowDecent and calmGolden sunbeams on my noseWarmth in my heartYou used to give it to meAlmostA kiss on the neckBread fresh from the ovenJust the two of usThe day after a partyDrowsily snuggling up to you
Your reproachful look says it allSo does the silence between us(Dissatisfaction bred envy)How can you want toBe what I am if you doNot know me at allYou're saying' I'm a loserEven that you're not quite sure about it(Envy bred anger)How can you want toHave my life if you do not know it at allYou have to know your life could be your dream4 times:You wanna be what I amI wanna be what you are
Your coat and hat are goneI really can't look at your little empty shelfA ragged teddy bearIt feels like we never had a chanceDon't look me in the eyeWe lay in each others armsBut the room is just an empty spaceI guess we've lived it outSomething in the airWe smiled too fast then can't think of a thing to sayLived with the best timesLeft with the worstI've danced with you too longNothing left to saveLet's take what we canI know you hold your head up highWe've raced for the last timeA place of no returnAnd there's something in the air
There is fiction in the space betweenThe lines on your page of memoriesWrite it down but it doesn't meanYou're not just telling storiesThere is fiction in the space betweenYou and realityYou will do and say anythingTo make your everyday lifeSeem less mundaneThere is fiction in the space betweenYou and me
Ten after one I think I'll hop the horseDowntown late of three of courseJust came from fishing couldn't get a catchDowntown they'll probably have a batchA whiting sandwich and a Guinness StoutBut with the beer though I had a boutSo I exchanged it for some apple juiceI had the blues but I shook them looseA jeep is blasting from the urban streetsLoots of funk over hardcore beatsThe moon dabbles in the morning skyAs the minutes just creep on byI get a thought and hear comes my TribeRitual shakes and in good vibesLike always the Quest beginsIn the mist though but the rhyth's move inWe find a spot and we sit and chatSpeaking on the status quo of rapA derelick makes a real long speachWe pay attention to the words he readWhen he was done we rattled onThere was no lunch because it wasn't dawnWe pointed things out about this timesThe worlds famons and the crazy crimesInflation of the nation, it bothers meI better go gold, to pay the taxes

Each blaspemy is another stone to the edifice of your gloryAm I the rock on which you'll build your churchAm I the son you've been waiting for?Am I the chosen one?To be your messiah on earthAnd to sit at your left in hell
Prisoner of my dreamsSlave to my illusionsParalysed by the anguish of a new dayTormented by the desire of gloryThe thirst for powerI'm refuging into the pentagramWhere I fear nobody
What I really hate is music like yoursMakes me want to smash your head through a doorKill yourself, go dieIt'd be a better place in my eyesMust be some kind of sick jokeFact you exsist makes me want to chokeWe hate your musicWe hate you tooWe've got our reasonsFor what we doYou cannot hideYou stupid fucksWe really thinkYour music sucksWhere did you come from? Go back
As you brush your shoesStand before the mirrorAnd you comb your hairGrab your coat and hatAnd you walkWet streets tryin' to rememberAll the wild night breezes in your memory everAnd everything looks so completeWhen you're walkin' out on the streetAnd the wind catches your feetSends you flyin', cryin'Ooh, woo, weeWild night is calling, alright
You can take all the tea in ChinaPut it in a big brown bag for meSail right around all the seven oceansDrop it straight into the deep blue seaShe's as sweet as tupelo honeyShe's an angel of the first degreeShe's as sweet, she's as sweet as tupelo honeyJust like honey, baby, from the beeYou can't stop us on the road to freedomAnd you can't keep us, 'cause our eyes can seeMen with insight, men in granitesKnights in armor bent on chivalryShe's as sweet as tupelo honeyShe's an angel of the first degree (She's an angel)She's as sweet as tupelo honeyJust like honey, baby, from the bee
Once in a blue moonSomethin' good comes alongOnce in a blue moonEvery thing's not goin' wrongWhen you get wearyBeating on the same old goingOnce in a blue moonSomeone like you comes alongOnce every once in a whileSomething comes along that feels just rightOnce every once in a whileJust like switching on an electric lightAnd sometimes you tryTill you're blue in the faceBut when you get that feelingNothings gonna take its place
Your the one that i adore, i adore your the,Your the one that i adore, i adoreYour the one that i adore, i adore your the,Your the one that i adore, i adoreAnd there u were standing in the rain oh oh oh
